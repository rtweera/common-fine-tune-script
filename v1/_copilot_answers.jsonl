{"question": "I'm exploring the services available in the marketplace and notice there are many listed. What is the primary goal of this marketplace, and what are the main ways I can quickly find a specific service among potentially hundreds?", "answer": "\nThe primary goal of Choreo's API Marketplace is to provide users with a wide range of APIs to choose from, enabling them to easily discover and integrate various services into their applications. To efficiently locate a specific service among numerous options, users can utilize the search functionality and filters available on the marketplace's user interface. By entering keywords related to the desired service or applying filters based on categories, API types, versions, or other relevant criteria, users can narrow down their search and quickly find the specific service they are looking for. Additionally, users can explore detailed API descriptions, endpoints, and documentation to determine if a particular service meets their requirements before integrating it into their applications."}
{"question": "When I browse the marketplace, I see services listed with version numbers like 'v1' or 'v2'. How does the platform handle versioning for these services, and if I build a new service that depends on another service (say, 'Service A v1'), what happens automatically if 'Service A' later releases a new minor version (like v1.3 after I connected to v1.2)?", "answer": ""}
