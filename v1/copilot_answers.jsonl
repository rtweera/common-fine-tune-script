{"question": "What are the typical steps involved in a Choreo build pipeline?", "answer": "A typical Choreo build pipeline consists of several key steps that facilitate the building and deployment of your components. Here's an overview of these steps:\n\n1. **Build Container Image**: Choreo begins by building a container image either from the source code you've provided or from a specified Dockerfile for a specific commit.\n\n2. **Security and Vulnerability Scans**: The build pipeline runs security and vulnerability scans, depending on the type of component being built. This ensures that the built image is secure before it is pushed to a registry.\n\n3. **Push to Container Registry**: Once the image is built and scanned, it is pushed to a container registry. For a Choreo-managed cloud data plane, the image is stored in a registry managed by Choreo. If you're using a private data plane, the image is pushed to your own registry.\n\n4. **Update Service Endpoints and API Specifications**: If applicable, the service endpoints and API specifications are updated based on the information provided in your repository.\n\n5. **Integration of Unit Tests (Optional)**: Some buildpacks allow for the integration of unit tests into the build pipeline, enabling you to ensure that your code behaves as expected before deployment.\n\n6. **Triggering Builds**: You can manually trigger a build from the Build page by clicking **Build Latest** or set up automatic builds on each commit by enabling the **Auto Build on Commit** feature.\n\n7. **Build Logs**: You can view the logs of the builds on the Build page to check for any issues or confirmations of success.\n\nThese steps ensure a smooth transition from code to deployment, safeguarding the integrity and security of your applications throughout the process. For more detailed information, you can refer to the [Choreo Build documentation](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/ci-cd/#build)."}
{"question": "Can I integrate unit tests into the build process?", "answer": "Yes, unit tests can be integrated into the build process in Choreo. This integration allows for code validation before deployment, ensuring that any changes are tested early and reducing the risk of defects in production. However, it's important to note that Choreo currently supports unit tests only for the `WSO2 MI` buildpack.\n\nHere’s how you can integrate unit tests into your build pipeline:\n\n### Step 1: Write Tests\nYou need to create unit tests within your source code using standard testing libraries. For specific instructions on creating unit tests for WSO2 Micro Integrator projects, you can refer to the guide on [Creating a Unit Test Suite](https://mi.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/develop/creating-unit-test-suite/).\n\n### Step 2: Enable Unit Tests\n1. In the **Component Listing** pane, click on the component for which you want to enable unit tests.\n2. In the left navigation menu, click on **Build**.\n3. On the **Build** page, click to edit **Build Configurations**.\n4. Turn on the **Unit Test** toggle.\n5. Click **Save**.\n\n### Step 3: Trigger a New Build\n- On the **Build** page, click **Build Latest**. This action will start a new build with the unit tests enabled, and you can monitor its progress in the **Build Details** pane.\n\n### Viewing Failed Unit Tests\nIf a unit test fails during the build process, you can view detailed logs for troubleshooting. Click **View Details** corresponding to the failed build, and then expand the failed unit test step to access the logs.\n\nFor a practical example, you can explore the [WSO2 MI helloworld](https://github.com/wso2/choreo-samples/tree/main/hello-world-mi) sample to see unit tests in action within the build pipeline.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the documentation on [Integrate Unit Tests into the Build Pipeline](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/integrate-unit-tests-into-the-build-pipeline/)."}
{"question": "What are 'repeatable builds' in Choreo?", "answer": "In Choreo, \"repeatable builds\" refer to the capability of the platform to replicate builds from an identical code version, specifically a Git commit. This means that if multiple builds are initiated from the same commit, Choreo will generate Docker images that behave the same way each time. This functionality ensures consistency across builds, which is critical for maintaining stability and reliability in deployment processes.\n\n### Implementation of Repeatable Builds in Choreo\n\n1. **Build Triggering**: You can initiate a build from the **Build** page in the Choreo console. There are options to build the latest version or select a specific commit to build an image from.\n   \n2. **Build Process**: During the build process, Choreo performs several steps:\n   - It builds a container image from the source code or a Dockerfile associated with the selected commit.\n   - Security and vulnerability scans may be carried out, depending on the component type.\n   - The built image is then pushed to a container registry (either Choreo-managed or your own, if using a private data plane).\n   - It updates service endpoints and API specifications as necessary.\n\n3. **Image Management**: When multiple builds are triggered from the same code version, Choreo retains only the most recent Docker image created from that specific version. This means that any previous images from the same commit are replaced, which helps in managing storage and ensuring that only the latest build is used.\n\n4. **Auto Build on Commit**: If you want to automate this process, you can enable the **Auto Build on Commit** feature, which triggers a build automatically with each commit made to the connected Git repository.\n\nBy leveraging these features, Choreo ensures that developers can achieve consistent and reliable deployments, making it easier to maintain applications over time.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the documentation: [Choreo CI/CD Build Documentation](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/ci-cd/#build)."}

Note that you need to trigger the first build manually.\n\n### Automating Deployments\n\nTo automate deployments further, you can integrate your existing CI/CD pipeline with Choreo:\n\n1. **Build and Push Image**: Use your CI pipeline to build and push the container image to the container registry.\n\n2. **Integrate with Choreo**:\n   - In the Choreo console, navigate to **DevOps** and then **External CI** to generate a token for your CI pipeline.\n   - Store the token securely, as it is specific to your component.\n\n3. **Trigger Automatic Deployment**:\n   - Use an HTTP POST request to the Choreo webhook endpoint with the updated image details. This can be done directly from your CI pipeline to trigger a deployment whenever a new image is available.\n\n4. **Webhook Configuration**: You can refer to the webhook snippets provided by Choreo to set this up seamlessly.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively deploy a container image in Choreo and automate future deployments. \n\nFor more detailed steps and configurations, you can refer to the documentation:\n- [Auto-deploy images in Choreo with an external CI/build pipeline](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/bring-your-own-image/#auto-deploy-images-in-choreo-with-an-external-cibuild-pipeline)\n- [Deployment](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/ci-cd/#deployment)"}
{"question": "Are there any special considerations for deploying Ballerina components?", "answer": "When deploying Ballerina components in Choreo, there are several special considerations to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Java Runtime Compatibility**: \n   - If you have created components using the Ballerina preset, it is highly recommended to redeploy your components before any infrastructure upgrades. This ensures that your component is built using the latest Java Runtime version, which is crucial for compatibility.\n\n2. **Initial Deployment**: \n   - The first build of a Ballerina component must be triggered manually. This allows Choreo to apply the necessary configurations to the development environment. After this initial deployment, you can enable automatic builds and deployments.\n\n3. **Configurable Management**: \n   - Choreo manages Ballerina configurables, allowing you to modify these configurables during deployment or promotion via the Deploy page. This is crucial because if you change any configurables, it may lead to failures in automatic build pipelines to prevent runtime crashes.\n\n4. **Immutable Deployments**: \n   - Once a component is deployed with specific configurations, those configurations become immutable. Any subsequent changes will require a new deployment.\n\n5. **Promoting Components**: \n   - Choreo builds a container once per GitHub commit, and you can promote it across higher environments from the Deploy page of a component.\n\n6. **Backward Compatibility**: \n   - If you change the configurations in your Ballerina component, ensure backward compatibility with at least one previous release to avoid issues.\n\nFor more detailed steps on deploying Ballerina components in Choreo, including how to manage configurations and perform deployments, you can refer to the following documentation links:\n- [Choreo Kubernetes Infrastructure Upgrade Notice](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/resources/kubernetes-upgrade-notice/#action-required)\n- [CI/CD Deployment](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/ci-cd/#deployment)\n- [Manage Ballerina Configurables](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/manage-configurations-and-secrets/#manage-ballerina-configurables)\n\nThese considerations will help ensure a smooth deployment process for your Ballerina components in Choreo."}
{"question": "What happens if I change configurations after a component is deployed?", "answer": "Changing configurations of a component in Choreo after deployment can have several effects depending on the type of configurations being modified. Here’s a breakdown of what happens with different types of configurations:\n\n### Environment-independent Configurations\n- **Definition**: These configurations apply to all environments.\n- **Modification Process**: To change these configurations, you need to go to the **Deploy** page of the component, make the necessary changes via the **Set Up** card, and then trigger a new deployment. After that, you can promote the component to higher environments.\n- **Effect**: Changing these configurations will result in a new deployment of the component, which may impact the behavior of the service across all environments where it is deployed.\n\n### Environment-specific Configurations\n- **Definition**: These configurations are specific to a particular environment.\n- **Modification Process**: To change them, navigate to the **Deploy** page, make the necessary changes in the specific environment card, and trigger a new deployment.\n- **Effect**: Similar to environment-independent configurations, modifying these configurations will also lead to a new deployment, affecting only the specified environment.\n\n### Immutable Deployments\nOnce a component is deployed with certain configurations, those configurations become immutable. This means any change to the configurations will necessitate a new deployment. In essence, the existing deployment remains unchanged until you initiate a new deployment with updated configurations.\n\n### Zero-downtime Deployments\nChoreo ensures zero downtime between deployments and promotions through rolling updates. If you have set up health checks for your component, these checks will be performed on the new build before switching traffic from the current build, which helps maintain service availability.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, changing configurations of a component after deployment leads to a new deployment, which can impact the behavior of the component. It’s essential to ensure that any changes are thoroughly tested and that health checks are configured to avoid deploying unhealthy versions of the component.\n\nFor more detailed information on managing configurations, you can refer to the [Configuration Management document](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/ci-cd/#configurations)."}
{"question": "How do I promote a component from one environment to another, like from development to production?", "answer": "To promote a component from one environment to another in Choreo, you need to follow a structured process that involves requesting approval for the promotion.

{"question": "Does Choreo ensure my application stays online during deployments or promotions?", "answer": "Choreo handles deployments to ensure that applications remain online and experience no downtime during the process through a mechanism known as **zero-downtime deployments**. Here’s how it works:\n\n1. **Rolling Updates**: Choreo performs rolling updates, meaning that instead of shutting down the entire application for an update, it updates the application incrementally. This ensures that parts of the application remain available while others are being updated.\n\n2. **Health Checks**: Before switching traffic from the current build to the new build, Choreo conducts a health check. This step is crucial as it verifies the new build's functionality and readiness for production. If the health checks are not successful, the deployment can be halted, preventing any potential issues from affecting the live application.\n\n3. **Configuration of Health Checks**: For a component, it’s important to configure the necessary health checks. This configuration helps in preventing the deployment of unhealthy versions of the component, ensuring that only stable and functional versions are promoted to production.\n\nThese features work together to minimize the risk of downtime during deployments, allowing for a smoother transition between versions of your applications.\n\nFor more detailed information on zero-downtime deployments in Choreo, you can visit the following documentation link: [Zero-downtime deployments](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/ci-cd/#zero-downtime-deployments)."}

For instance, if one component requires more resources due to increased traffic, it can be scaled up without affecting the other components in the application.\n\nAdditionally, Choreo supports features like **scale-to-zero**, which allows applications to scale down to zero when not in use, thus optimizing resource usage. When a request comes in after a period of inactivity, the application can scale back up to handle the request, ensuring efficient management of resources.\n\nOverall, Choreo's architecture and capabilities facilitate the independent management and scaling of application components, making it suitable for cloud-native applications.\n\nFor more details, you can refer to the following documentation:\n- [Component](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/component/)\n- [Autoscale Components with Scale-to-Zero](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/autoscale/autoscale-components-with-scale-to-zero/#architecture)"}
{"question": "What are 'Connections' in Choreo and why would I use them?", "answer": "In Choreo, **Connections** are a fundamental feature that allows you to integrate and share services, enhancing the efficiency of building applications. Connections enable you to link your service with other services on Choreo or even with external resources, facilitating the creation of integrated solutions.\n\n### Types of Connections\n\n1. **Component Connections**: \n   - These are defined at the component level and are exclusive to that specific component.\n   - They are useful for connecting a component to a legacy service or other Choreo services.\n   - If a component utilizes multiple Choreo services, connections can share the same OAuth application by using the same client ID and secret.\n\n2. **Project Connections**: \n   - These connections are created at the project level and can be utilized by any component within that project.\n   - They are ideal for sharing services like third-party APIs across multiple components in a project.\n   - Project connections under the OAuth security scheme will also share the same OAuth application across all components that reuse them.\n\n### Benefits of Using Connections\n\n- **Reusability**: By creating connections, services can be reused across different components and projects, reducing duplication and saving time.\n- **Ease of Maintenance**: The connection parameters can be set up to be loosely coupled with the service implementation. This means that changes to the connection parameters do not require changes in the service code, making it easier to maintain.\n- **Dynamic Configuration**: Choreo dynamically injects connection parameter values into environment variables at runtime, ensuring flexibility in how services are connected.\n- **Integrated Development**: Connections enable seamless integration of various services, making it easier to create complex applications that leverage multiple resources.\n\nOverall, using connections in Choreo accelerates the development process and enhances the overall efficiency of building integrated applications.\n\nFor more detailed information on creating and using connections, you can refer to the documentation on [Connections](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/connections/)."}
{"question": "How do I use a Connection in my service once it's created in Choreo?", "answer": "To use a Connection in your service after it has been created in Choreo, follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Add Connection Configurations\nIntegrate the connection into your service by modifying the `component.yaml` file of your service. Depending on the version of the `component.yaml` you are using, the steps will differ slightly.\n\n#### For `component.yaml v1.1`:\n1. Add the following snippet to the `component.yaml` file:\n   ```yaml\n   dependencies:\n     connectionReferences:\n     - name: <CONNECTION_NAME>\n       resourceRef: <RESOURCE_IDENTIFIER>\n   ```\n   - Replace `<CONNECTION_NAME>` with the name of your connection.\n   - Replace `<RESOURCE_IDENTIFIER>` with a unique identifier for the service being connected to.\n\n2. If you have an existing `connectionReferences` section, append this configuration.\n\n3. Upon deployment, Choreo will create a subscription if applicable, and the required configurations will be automatically injected into the Choreo-defined environment variables.\n\n#### For `component.yaml v1.0` (Legacy):\n1. Add the following snippet to the `component.yaml` file:\n   ```yaml\n   dependencies:\n     serviceReferences:\n     - name: <SERVICE_NAME>\n       connectionConfig: <CONNECTION_ID>\n       env:\n       - from: ServiceURL\n         to: <YOUR_ENV_VARIABLE_NAME_HERE>\n       - from: ConsumerKey\n         to: <YOUR_ENV_VARIABLE_NAME_HERE>\n       - from: ConsumerSecret\n         to: <YOUR_ENV_VARIABLE_NAME_HERE>\n       - from: TokenURL\n         to: <YOUR_ENV_VARIABLE_NAME_HERE>\n       - from: ChoreoAPIKey\n         to: <YOUR_ENV_VARIABLE_NAME_HERE>\n   ```\n   - Replace `<SERVICE_NAME>` with the name of the service you are connecting to, and `<CONNECTION_ID>` with the unique connection identifier.\n\n2. Replace `<YOUR_ENV_VARIABLE_NAME_HERE>` with the names you want to use for the environment variables.\n\n### Step 2: Read Configurations within the Application\nYou can access the connection parameters in your application code using environment variables. For instance, in Node.js, you would read the configurations as follows:\n```javascript\nconst serviceURL = process.env.CHOREO_<CONNECTION_NAME>_SERVICEURL;\n```\n\n### Step 3: Acquire an OAuth 2.0 Access Token (if applicable)\nIf your service requires OAuth 2.0 authentication, you'll need to obtain an access token. You can do this by making a request to the token endpoint with your consumer key and secret.\n\n### Step 4: Invoke the Service\nOnce you have the necessary configurations and access token, you can make HTTP requests to the connected service. Depending on your authentication method, the request may look like this:\n\n- For API Key security:\n```javascript\nconst response = await axios.get(`${serviceURL}/{RESOURCE_PATH}`, {\n  headers: {\n    'Choreo-API-Key': `${choreoApiKey}`\n  }\n});\n```\n\n- For OAuth 2.0:\n```javascript\nconst response = await axios.get(`${serviceURL}/{RESOURCE_PATH}`, {\n  headers: {\n    'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`\n  }\n});\n```\n\nBy following these steps, you can successfully use a Connection in your service within Choreo.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the documentation here: [Use a Connection in Your Service](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/sharing-and-reusing/use-a-connection-in-your-service/)."}

{"question": "What's the difference between Project Connections and Component Connections in Choreo?", "answer": "In Choreo, there are two types of connections: Project Connections and Component Connections, each serving distinct purposes within your projects.\n\n### Project Connections\n- **Scope**: These connections are created at the project level.\n- **Usage**: They can be utilized by any component within the same project. This makes it convenient to share services across multiple components.\n- **Example**: If you need to integrate a third-party service like Twilio across various components in your project, you would create a Project Connection. All components can then refer to this connection using its connection ID.\n- **OAuth Application**: When Project Connections are used to consume Choreo services under the OAuth security scheme, they share the same OAuth application, meaning all components using this connection will employ the same client ID and client secret.\n\nFor more details, you can refer to the [Project Connections documentation](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/connections/#project-connections).\n\n### Component Connections\n- **Scope**: These connections are defined at the individual component level.\n- **Usage**: They are exclusive to the component in which they are created, meaning other components in the project cannot use them.\n- **Example**: If you need a specific component to connect to a legacy service, you would create a Component Connection that only that component can utilize.\n- **OAuth Application**: Similar to Project Connections, if a Component Connection consumes Choreo services under the OAuth security scheme, it can also share the same OAuth application by using the same client ID and secret among multiple Component Connections within the same component.\n\nFor additional information, you can check the [Component Connections documentation](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/connections/#component-connections).\n\n### Summary of Differences\n- **Visibility**: Project Connections are available to all components in a project, while Component Connections are limited to a single component.\n- **Purpose**: Use Project Connections for shared services across multiple components; use Component Connections for service integrations specific to a single component.\n\nThese distinctions help in organizing and managing connections effectively in Choreo, ensuring that the right services are accessible to the appropriate components."}
{"question": "When should I use a Project Connection instead of a Component Connection? Can you give an example?", "answer": "In Choreo, there are two types of connections: **Project Connections** and **Component Connections**. Each serves a different purpose depending on the scope of usage within your projects.\n\n### Project Connections\n- **Definition**: Project Connections are created to connect to services within a specific project. These connections can be utilized by any component within that project.\n- **Use Case**: If you have a third-party service, like Twilio, that you want to make available to all components in your project, you would create a Project Connection. This allows all components to reuse the same connection without needing to create individual connections for each component.\n- **Example**: If you are building multiple microservices that all need access to the same external API, you can define a Project Connection for that API. All services can reference this single connection ID, simplifying management and reducing redundancy.\n\n### Component Connections\n- **Definition**: Component Connections, on the other hand, are defined at the component level and are only used by that specific component.\n- **Use Case**: If a component requires a unique connection to a service that is not shared with other components, you would create a Component Connection. This is useful for services that are specific to a particular functionality or that do not need to be exposed to other components.\n- **Example**: Consider a scenario where you have a legacy service that only one component needs to connect to. In this case, you would create a Component Connection specifically for that component, allowing it to interact with the legacy service without exposing that connection to other components in the project.\n\n### Summary of Differences\n- **Scope of Use**: \n  - Project Connections are reusable across all components within the same project.\n  - Component Connections are limited to the specific component that created them.\n  \n- **Ideal Scenarios**:\n  - Use **Project Connections** for shared resources or services that multiple components will use.\n  - Use **Component Connections** for services or resources that are exclusive to a single component.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the respective sections in the Choreo documentation:\n- [Project Connections](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/connections/#project-connections)\n- [Component Connections](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/connections/#component-connections)"}
{"question": "When is it more appropriate to use a Component Connection?", "answer": "In Choreo, **Component Connections** are designed for use at the component level, meaning they are utilized exclusively by a specific component. Here are some scenarios where it is more appropriate to use a Component Connection:\n\n1. **Isolated Dependencies**: If your component requires a connection to a service (like a legacy service) that is not shared with other components, defining a Component Connection is ideal. This ensures the connection is tightly coupled with that specific component and does not affect or interfere with other components.\n\n2. **Multiple Connections**: If your component needs to consume multiple Choreo services, you can create Component Connections for each service. Notably, if these services use the OAuth security scheme, they can share the same OAuth application by using the same client ID and secret, simplifying authentication management.\n\n3. **No Cross-Component Sharing Needed**: When you do not intend for the connection to be reused across different components within the same project, a Component Connection is the best choice. This keeps your component's dependencies self-contained.\n\nFor example, if you are building a component that integrates with a specific database or an external API and you want to keep that integration unique to that component, using a Component Connection would be the most appropriate approach.\n\nFor more detailed information about Component Connections, you can refer to the documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/connections/#component-connections)."}
{"question": "How do Project Connections handle OAuth security when shared across multiple components?", "answer": "In Choreo, when sharing Project Connections among multiple components, OAuth security is handled in a cohesive manner to streamline the authentication process across the various components. Here's how it works:\n\n### Project Connections\n- **Definition**: Project Connections are connections created to link to services within a specific project. These connections can be reused by any component within that project.\n- **OAuth Application Sharing**: When Project Connections are set up to consume services secured with OAuth, they utilize a shared OAuth application across the project. This means that all components that refer to this Project Connection will use the same **client ID** and **client secret**.\n\n### Benefits of Shared OAuth Security\n1. **Simplified Management**: By sharing the same OAuth credentials (client ID and secret) across components, it simplifies the management of OAuth configurations. You don't need to manage separate credentials for each component.\n2. **Consistent Security**: All components using the Project Connection will adhere to the same security policies defined by the OAuth application, ensuring consistent security practices throughout the project.\n\n### Implementation Steps\n- To set up a Project Connection with OAuth security:\n  1. Create the Project Connection in the Choreo console.\n  2. Configure it to consume the desired Choreo services with the OAuth scheme.\n  3. Use the connection ID in your components to refer to this shared connection.\n\n### Accessing Services\nWhen a component needs to access a service through the Project Connection:\n- It will authenticate using the shared client ID and client secret.\n- The component can then make calls to the secured service without needing to implement the OAuth flow individually.\n\nThis approach enhances security and reduces complexity in managing OAuth tokens and credentials across multiple components.\n\nFor further details, you can refer to the documentation on Project Connections [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/connections/#project-connections)."}
{"question": "If my component consumes multiple Choreo services, can Component Connections help with OAuth?", "answer": "Yes, Component Connections in Choreo can facilitate OAuth authentication for components that consume multiple services.

Here's when to increment each version type:\n\n### Incrementing Major and Minor Versions\n\n1. **Major Version Increment**:\n   - You should increment the **major version** when you introduce **incompatible API changes**. These changes may break existing client integrations, requiring consumers to update their implementations to remain compatible with the new version.\n   - For example, if you change the structure of the API response or remove an endpoint, this would necessitate a major version change.\n\n2. **Minor Version Increment**:\n   - Increment the **minor version** when you add functionality in a **backward-compatible manner**. This means that existing clients can continue to function without any modifications while benefiting from new features.\n   - For instance, adding a new endpoint or introducing optional parameters to existing endpoints would require a minor version increment.\n\n### Version Format\nIn Choreo, the versioning format follows the pattern **`v{major}.{minor}`**, such as `v1.2`.\n\n### Context of Deployment Tracks\nWhen working with Deployment Tracks, only the major and minor versions need to be specified, as these serve as the version attributes for a deployment track. This design simplifies the management of API versions and improves the overall experience for both API creators and consumers.\n\nFor more information, you can refer to the documentation on efficient API versioning in Deployment Tracks: [Efficient API versioning](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/deployment-tracks/#efficient-api-versioning)."}
{"question": "If Choreo's API versioning focuses on major and minor versions, how do I manage patch updates or internal version tracking?", "answer": "Choreo manages API versioning using a system based on Semantic Versioning (SemVer), focusing primarily on the major and minor versions. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Versioning Mechanism**: In Choreo, the versioning format used is `vX.Y`, where `X` represents the major version and `Y` represents the minor version. \n   - Major versions are incremented when there are incompatible changes to the API.\n   - Minor versions are incremented when new functionality is added in a backward-compatible manner.\n\n2. **Patch Updates**: While the versioning system primarily focuses on major and minor versions, patch updates (which typically do not introduce breaking changes) can still be important from a consumer perspective. These patch updates are often categorized as changes that don’t require significant communication to API consumers, as they should ideally not disrupt their API clients.\n\n3. **Deployment Tracks**: For deployment tracks, the API developer specifies only the major and minor versions. This means that when deploying a service, the versioning relevant to consumers is simplified to major and minor versions, ensuring that consumers are not affected by patch-level changes.\n\n4. **Internal Version Tracking**: For internal version tracking or for more granular version control, developers can utilize Git tags and GitHub releases. This means that while the public-facing API uses major and minor versioning for clarity and consumer stability, developers can track all changes, including patch updates, using internal tools and methodologies.\n\n5. **Marketplace Integration**: In the Choreo Marketplace, services are also displayed by their major version, ensuring that clients are always routed to the latest minor version available within that major version. This assists in maintaining continuity and stability for consumers while allowing developers to push minor updates.\n\nBy following this structured versioning approach, Choreo facilitates efficient API management that minimizes disruption for API consumers while allowing developers to manage their service versions effectively.\n\nFor more details on versioning in Choreo, you can refer to the relevant documentation here: [Efficient API versioning](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/deployment-tracks/#efficient-api-versioning) and [Service versioning in the Choreo Marketplace](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/choreo-marketplace/#service-versioning-in-the-choreo-marketplace)."}
{"question": "What exactly is an Endpoint in Choreo?", "answer": "An **endpoint** in Choreo is defined as a network-exposed function that resides within a component. Each service or integration component can expose one or more endpoints, and each of these endpoints acts as a unique entry point into the service. This means that different endpoints can provide various interfaces for interacting with your service, such as REST and GraphQL endpoints.\n\n### Role of Endpoints in API Management and Integrations\n\n1. **API Exposure**: Endpoints are crucial for exposing services to other services, integrations, or applications. They detail how a service can be consumed, including specifics like port number, protocol, and schema (e.g., OpenAPI specification or GraphQL schema).\n\n2. **Standardized Interaction**: By defining endpoints with specific attributes (such as port binding, protocol, and network visibility), Choreo enables standardized interaction with services. This ensures that other applications can easily discover and communicate with your service.\n\n3. **API Management**: Choreo allows for API management at the endpoint level, enabling lifecycle management and configuration of security settings for each endpoint. This includes capabilities like throttling, analytics, and monitoring, ensuring that APIs are secure and manageable.\n\n4. **Visibility Control**: Endpoints can be configured with different network visibility options (Project, Organization, Public), determining who can access them. This feature is vital for controlling access to your services and protecting sensitive information.\n\n5. **Managed APIs**: When endpoints are exposed as managed APIs, they are subject to Choreo's API management features, including lifecycle management and security policies. This allows for full control over how the APIs are utilized, monitored, and maintained.\n\nIn summary, endpoints play a critical role in both API management and integrations by providing clear, structured access points to your services, facilitating standardized interactions, and enabling robust management features.\n\nFor more detailed information on configuring endpoints in Choreo, you can refer to the documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/endpoint/)."}
{"question": "Do I need to provide a service contract for an endpoint in Choreo, and what happens if I don't?", "answer": "In Choreo, providing a service contract for an endpoint is optional, but it is highly recommended. Each endpoint in a component can have a service contract (such as OpenAPI or GraphQL SDL) associated with it, which serves to define how consumers can interact with the endpoint. \n\nIf you choose not to provide a service contract, Choreo defaults to a general contract represented by `/*` exposed on all HTTP verbs. This means that while the endpoint will still be accessible, it will lack the specificity and structured guidance that a proper service contract offers. This can lead to confusion for consumers regarding how to properly interact with the endpoint, as they won’t have a clear understanding of the expected request and response formats.\n\nIn summary:\n- **Service Contract**: Defines how consumers interact with an endpoint.\n- **Default Behavior**: If not provided, Choreo uses a generic contract, which may not be as informative for users of the service.\n\nFor more detailed information on configuring endpoints and the importance of service contracts, you can refer to the documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/endpoint/)."}
{"question": "How does Choreo handle API management for endpoints? Can I manage each endpoint separately?", "answer": "Choreo provides a robust API management system that allows you to manage API endpoints effectively, including the capability to handle each endpoint separately. Here’s how Choreo handles API management for endpoints:\n\n### Endpoint Definition\nIn Choreo, an **endpoint** is a network-exposed function that resides within a component, such as a service or integration component. Each component can expose multiple endpoints, which can represent different entry points into that service. This includes various types such as REST APIs and GraphQL endpoints.\n\n### API Management Features\n1. **Service Contracts**: Each endpoint can be associated with a service contract (like OpenAPI or GraphQL SDL). If no contract is provided, Choreo defaults to exposing all HTTP verbs with a wildcard (`/*`).\n\n2. **Lifecycle and Security Management**: Choreo enables lifecycle management and security configurations on a per-endpoint basis. This means you can manage individual endpoints according to your needs, providing flexibility in how they are deployed and accessed.\n\n3. **Network Visibility**: The visibility of each endpoint can be configured to be project-specific, organization-specific, or public. This determines who can access the endpoint and how.\n\n4. **Expose Endpoints as Managed APIs**: For security and controlled access, endpoints can be exposed as managed APIs through the Choreo API Gateway. This feature allows you to utilize full lifecycle API management, API throttling, secure authorization flows, and analytics for each endpoint.\n\n5. **API Key Management**: Once an endpoint is exposed as a managed API, you can create and manage API keys for secure access. This management can be performed through the Choreo Developer Portal, where you can monitor and control API access effectively.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, Choreo facilitates detailed API management for each endpoint, allowing you to customize security, lifecycle, and exposure settings individually. If you want to configure endpoints or learn more about API management features, you can refer to the following documentation:\n\n- [Configure Endpoints](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/configure-endpoints)\n- [Expose Endpoints as Managed APIs](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/configure-endpoints-body/#expose-endpoints-as-managed-apis)"}
{"question": "What kind of API management tasks can I perform for an individual endpoint in Choreo?", "answer": "In Choreo, you can perform several API management tasks for an individual endpoint. Here’s a comprehensive list of these tasks:\n\n1. **Lifecycle Management**: Manage the lifecycle of the API endpoint, which includes various states such as created, pre-released, published, blocked, deprecated, and retired. This helps ensure that subscribers have access to the latest and most reliable APIs.\n\n2. **Security Settings**: Configure security settings for the endpoint, which may include setting up role-based access control to restrict or allow certain users or roles to access the API.\n\n3. **Expose as Managed API**: You can expose the endpoint as a managed API by setting its network visibility to either Organization or Public. This allows the endpoint to be accessible through the Choreo API Gateway, enabling full lifecycle API management, API throttling, analytics, and monitoring.\n\n4. **API Key Management**: Generate and manage API keys for secure access to the endpoint. This includes actions such as regenerating or deleting API keys associated with the API.\n\nThese tasks enable effective management of APIs and ensure that they are secure, accessible, and optimized for subscribers.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the following documentation:\n- [Configure Endpoints](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/configure-endpoints)\n- [API Management Lifecycle](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/api-management/lifecycle-management)\n- [Manage API Keys](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/consuming-services/manage-api-keys/)\n- [Expose endpoints as managed APIs](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/configure-endpoints-body/#expose-endpoints-as-managed-apis)"}
{"question": "Where can I find more detailed instructions on configuring endpoints when developing components in Choreo?", "answer": "To configure endpoints while developing components in Choreo, you have a couple of options depending on the buildpack you are using.\n\n### Configuring Endpoints\n\n1. **Automatic Detection**:\n   - For `Ballerina` and `WSO2 MI` buildpacks, Choreo automatically detects the endpoint details for REST APIs.\n\n2. **Manual Configuration**:\n   - For other buildpacks (Java, Python, NodeJS, Ruby, PHP, Go, Dockerfile, etc.), you can configure endpoints in one of the following ways:\n   - **Using the Choreo Console**: If a `component.yaml` file is not present, you can define a basic endpoint configuration during component creation.\n   - **Using the `component.yaml` file**: You can manually configure endpoint details by defining them in a `component.yaml` file, which should be placed inside the `.choreo` directory at the build context path and committed to your source repository. This `component.yaml` file will take priority over other configurations.\n\n   - **Dynamic Parameters**: If you need to define dynamic endpoint parameters (like variable ports), you must use a `component.yaml` file, as automatic endpoint generation does not support such parameters.\n\n### Additional Endpoint Configuration File\n- Choreo also supports an `endpoints.yaml` file for defining multiple endpoint configurations. This file should be placed in the `.choreo` directory and includes necessary attributes such as version, name, port, type, network visibility, context, and schema file path for the endpoints.\n\n### Example Structure of `endpoints.yaml`\n```yaml\nversion: 0.1\nendpoints:\n- name: Your Service\n  port: 9090\n  type: REST\n  networkVisibility: Project\n  context: /your-service\n  schemaFilePath: your_service_openapi.yaml\n```\n\n### Documentation Links\nFor more detailed instructions on configuring endpoints, you can refer to the following documentation:\n- [Configure Endpoints](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/configure-endpoints/)\n- [Overview of the `component.yaml` file](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/manage-component-source-configurations#overview-of-the-componentyaml-file)\n- [Manage Component Source Configurations](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/manage-component-source-configurations/)\n\nThese resources provide comprehensive guidance on how to set up and manage your endpoint configurations effectively."}
{"question": "What are environments in Choreo and why are they used?", "answer": "In Choreo, environments serve as isolated deployment areas for your applications and components. Each project can utilize one or more environments, which helps manage and segregate the different stages of your application lifecycle, such as development, testing, and production.\n\n### Purpose of Environments:\n1. **Isolation**: Each environment is isolated, meaning services deployed in one environment cannot communicate with those in another. This ensures that changes in one environment do not affect others, which is particularly useful for testing new features without impacting production.\n\n2. **Configuration Management**: Environments allow you to maintain separate configuration values and secrets specific to each deployment stage. For instance, while promoting a component from development to production, you can override certain configuration values to suit the production environment.\n\n3. **Streamlined CI/CD**: Choreo supports a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) process, enabling you to build your application once and deploy it across multiple environments. This means you can test your application in lower, non-production environments before promoting it to production.\n\n4. **Default Environments**: By default, Choreo provides two environments—development and production. However, users in a private data plane can create and customize additional environments based on their specific needs.\n\n5. **Secure Storage**: All configurations and secrets stored at the environment level are encrypted and managed securely, ensuring that sensitive information is protected.\n\n### Diagram of Component Promotion Across Environments\n![Choreo environments](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/assets/img/choreo-concepts/choreo-environments.png)\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the documentation on [Environments in Choreo](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/environments/) and [CI/CD in Choreo](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/ci-cd/)."}
{"question": "What environments does Choreo provide by default?", "answer": "Choreo provides two default environments for deploying services and managing APIs within the Choreo cloud data plane:\n\n1. **Development**: This environment is typically used for testing and development purposes. It allows developers to build and test their applications in a controlled setting before moving to production.\n\n2. **Production**: This environment is used for deploying live applications that are accessible to end-users. It is essential to ensure that all components are thoroughly tested in the development environment before being promoted to production.\n\nIn addition to these default environments, if you are operating within a private data plane organization, you have the flexibility to create and customize multiple environments based on your specific requirements.\n\nFor more details, you can refer to the documentation on [Choreo Environments](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/environments/)."}
{"question": "Can different projects in Choreo use a customized set of environments?", "answer": "Yes, different projects in Choreo can utilize a customized set of environments. By default, all projects are provisioned with two standard environments: development and production. However, each project can be configured to use one or more environments available within the organization. For example, one project may use development, staging, and production environments while another may only utilize development and production environments.\n\nAdditionally, in Choreo, you can create additional environments if you are using a private data plane organization, which allows for a more tailored setup based on your specific needs. This flexibility enables projects to have distinct environments according to their requirements, promoting components across these environments as needed.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the following documentation:\n- [Manage Continuous Deployment Pipelines](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/manage-continuous-deployment-pipelines/)\n- [Environments](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/environments/)\n- [CI/CD](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/ci-cd/)"}
{"question": "How do I move my application components between different environments in Choreo?", "answer": "In Choreo, moving or migrating application components between different environments is achieved through a process known as promotion. Here’s a comprehensive overview of how to manage this process:\n\n1. **Understanding Environments**: Choreo provides isolated environments for each project, which can include development, staging, and production. Each environment is designed to have restricted network and resource access, ensuring that services in one environment cannot communicate with services in another.\n\n2. **Build Once, Deploy Many Strategy**: When you create a component, it is built once per commit (if automatic builds are enabled) or based on a selected commit during manual builds. After building, you can promote this component to other environments as needed. This allows for testing in lower environments (like development) before moving to production.\n\n3. **Environment-Specific Configurations**: When promoting a component, you have the option to override its configuration values with environment-specific values. This means you can customize the behavior of the component for each environment it is deployed in.\n\n4. **Promotion Process**:\n   - You start by deploying the component to the initial environment, typically development.\n   - Once the component is successfully deployed and tested, you can promote it to the next environment (e.g., staging or production).\n   - To promote a component, navigate to the relevant section in the Choreo console where you can manage deployments and trigger the promotion.\n\n5. **Configuration Management**: You can define both environment-independent and environment-specific configurations. \n   - **Environment-independent configurations**: These are applicable across all environments and can be modified from the Deploy page of the component.\n   - **Environment-specific configurations**: These are tailored for each environment and can also be modified from the Deploy page.\n\nBy following this process, you can efficiently manage the movement of your application components across various environments in Choreo.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the following documentation:\n- [CI/CD](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/ci-cd/)\n- [Manage Environments](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/manage-environments/)\n- [Resource Hierarchy](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/resource-hierarchy/#components-and-environments)"}

{"question": "How does Choreo manage user permissions?", "answer": "Choreo manages user permissions and access control through a structured system that utilizes **Groups**, **Roles**, and a **Mapping level**. Here’s a detailed explanation of how this works:\n\n### Groups\nA group in Choreo is essentially a collection of users that can be assigned specific roles. Users within a group inherit the permissions associated with the roles assigned to that group. For example, if a user is part of the `API Publisher` group, they will automatically obtain the permissions associated with the API Publisher role.\n\nChoreo has predefined groups with specific roles, including:\n- **API Publisher**: Users who can create, publish, delete, and manage APIs.\n- **API Subscriber**: Developers who can manage subscriptions and generate API keys.\n- **Admin**: Users responsible for administration tasks including user management and project management.\n- **Billing Admin**: Users who manage billing and subscriptions.\n- **Choreo DevOps**: Users who manage deployment and monitor components.\n- **Developer**: Users who develop and manage applications.\n- **External API Subscriber**: API consumers with limited access to the Developer Portal.\n\n### Roles\nRoles in Choreo define the permissions associated with different user actions. Some key roles include:\n- **API Publisher**: Can manage APIs.\n- **API Subscriber**: Can manage subscriptions and applications.\n- **Admin**: Has full administrative rights.\n- **Developer**: Can develop and manage applications.\n\n### Access Control\nChoreo employs a mapping level for access control:\n- **Organization Level**: Assigning a role to a group at the organization level grants that group permissions across all organizational resources. \n- **Project Level**: Assigning a role to a group at the project level restricts permissions to that specific project.\n\nThis hierarchical structure allows for precise control over what users can do based on their roles and the context of the projects they are involved in.\n\n### Important Considerations\n- It is recommended to assign only one role to a user across projects or levels to avoid unintended access. \n- Organization-level permissions take precedence over project-level permissions, meaning that a user with organization-level access can perform actions across all projects within that organization.\n\nFor a visual aid on how access control is structured, you can refer to the diagram provided in the documentation.\n\nFor detailed steps on managing user permissions and access control, you can check the following links:\n- [Manage user permission](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/organization/#manage-user-permission)\n- [Control Access in the Choreo Console](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/administer/control-access-in-the-choreo-console/)"}

{"question": "How are data planes structured and shared within Choreo?", "answer": "Choreo's architecture consists of two main components: the control plane and the data plane. Here's a detailed explanation of the structure and sharing mechanism of data planes within Choreo:\n\n### Structure of Data Planes\n\n1. **Control Plane**: \n   - The control plane is responsible for managing organizations, users, projects, and the overall application development journey, including deployment and governance.\n\n2. **Data Plane**:\n   - The data plane is where user applications are deployed based on configurations set in the control plane. It supports various application types, including services, web applications, APIs, integrations, and scheduled tasks. \n   - Traffic related to the runtime of these applications is contained within the data plane, ensuring that user data remains secure.\n\n3. **Types of Data Planes**:\n   - **Cloud Data Planes**: Utilize a multi-tenanted infrastructure model, allowing multiple users to share a secure environment for application runtime.\n   - **Private Data Planes (PDPs)**: Offer dedicated infrastructure for a single organization, enhancing privacy and control over application deployments.\n\n### Sharing Mechanism\n\n- **Connectivity**:\n  - The private data plane communicates with the control plane for various activities. All communications are outbound from the private data plane, which means there is no need to configure specific inbound traffic for these interactions. However, if outbound traffic is restricted, organizations must allow traffic to the public IP range of the control plane.\n\n- **Management Models**:\n  - Choreo offers several management models for private data planes, enabling collaboration between WSO2 and customers:\n    - WSO2 fully managed (infrastructure and PDP in WSO2 subscription)\n    - WSO2 fully managed (infrastructure and PDP in customer subscription)\n    - Customer self-managed (installation script and updates provided by WSO2)\n\n- **Data Privacy and Compliance**:\n  - Logs and observability data are retained within the data plane, supporting data locality and compliance with regulations such as GDPR. This approach minimizes data exposure points and ensures that users have transparency and control over their data.\n\n- **Resource Hierarchy**:\n  - Data planes are connected to organizations and are available for all projects within that organization. When an environment is created in a project, it is linked to the data plane associated with the organization, which is reflected in a Kubernetes namespace.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn summary, Choreo's data planes are designed to provide secure, efficient runtime environments for user applications, with distinct types of data planes catering to different organizational needs. The sharing mechanism ensures that organizations can manage and deploy their applications while maintaining control and compliance with data privacy regulations.\n\nFor more detailed information about data planes in Choreo, you can refer to the following documentation links:\n- [Data Planes](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/data-planes/)\n- [Private Data Plane Management Models](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/references/private-data-plane-management-models/)\n- [Resource Hierarchy](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/resource-hierarchy/#organizations-and-data-planes)"}
