How does service versioning work in the Choreo Marketplace?,"In the Choreo Marketplace, service versions are displayed in their major version format (e.g., `v1`, `v2`). Each service entry represents the *latest* version of the service within its major version, following semantic versioning principles. For example, if you have `v1.0`, `v1.1`, and `v1.2`, the Marketplace will display `v1` representing `v1.2`. When a new minor version of an already deployed service is released, the corresponding service in the Marketplace automatically updates to reflect this latest version within the same major version.","
In the Choreo Marketplace, service versioning allows developers to manage different versions of services effectively. When a service is updated or modified, a new version is created to ensure backward compatibility and smooth transitions for existing users. 

To manage different versions of services effectively, developers can follow these processes and best practices:
1. **Semantic Versioning**: Follow semantic versioning (e.g., MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) to clearly communicate the impact of changes in each version.
2. **API Documentation**: Update API documentation for each version to provide clear information on changes, deprecations, and new features.
3. **Deprecation Policy**: Define a deprecation policy to inform users about the lifecycle of each version and when they will be phased out.
4. **Versioning Strategy**: Plan a versioning strategy that aligns with the service's roadmap and ensures smooth transitions for users.
5. **Testing and Validation**: Thoroughly test each version to ensure backward compatibility and prevent breaking changes for existing users.
6. **Communication**: Communicate version updates, changes, and deprecations effectively to users through release notes, announcements, and notifications.

Now, based on the provided API details, here are some relevant APIs that you can explore further:
1. **API Name**: choreo-be-demo
   - **Version**: v1.0
   - **Type**: REST
   - **Description**: This API is for testing choreo functionality.
   - **Endpoints**: 
     - GET /*
     - PUT /*
     - POST /*
     - DELETE /*
     - PATCH /*
   
2. **API Name**: Reading List REST Service in Go - Reading List
   - **Version**: 1.0.0
   - **Type**: REST
   - **Description**: This is a sample service that manages a list of reading items.
   - **Endpoints**:
     - GET /books List all the reading list books
     - POST /books Add a new book to the reading list
     - GET /books/{id} Get reading list book by id
     - PUT /books/{id} Update a reading list book by id
     - DELETE /books/{id} Delete a reading list book by id

These APIs showcase different services available in the Choreo Marketplace that you can explore for your development needs. If you need more information about a specific API or have any other questions, feel free to ask!","In the Choreo Marketplace, service versioning works by allowing you to specify different versions of a service or API. This is typically done using a version number or tag in the service's identifier. For example, you might see services listed as `service-name/v1`, `service-name/v2`, etc.

When you request a service from the marketplace, you can explicitly choose which version you want to use. This helps manage changes over time and ensures that you're using the correct version for your needs. If a new version of a service is released with breaking changes, you can continue to use the older version without it affects your workflows.

To implement versioninging in the Choreo Marketplace, you would:

1. Define multiple versions of your service in the documentation.
2. Use the version number when requesting the service in your choreography.
3. Update your choreographies to point to the desired version as needed.

4. **Configuration Settings**: You can configure various settings within an environment, such as logging levels, error handling strategies, or resource limits. This allows you to fine-tune how your workflows behave in different contexts.

5. **Switching Environments**: When you run a workflow, you specify which environment to use. This ensures that the workflow uses the correct configuration and data for that particular context.

To customize environments in Choreo:
- Go to the Environment section in the Choreo dashboard.
- Create or edit an environment.
- Add or modify variables and settings as needed.
- Save your changes.

"How does Choreo handle configurations and secrets for different environments, and are they secure?","Choreo injects configurations and secrets, which you maintain at the environment level, directly into components at runtime. This ensures a strict separation of environment-specific configurations from your source code, meaning the code and built container remain unchanged even if configurations vary across environments. These can include credentials for databases, caches, external cloud services like Amazon S3, or external APIs. All configurations and secrets are encrypted at rest and in transit and stored in a secure vault. In a private data plane organization, you also have the option to store them in your own infrastructure.","I'm sorry, but I don't have enough information to answer your question about how Choreo handles configurations and secrets for different environments and the associated security measures. If you have specific documentation or details, I would be happy to help clarify any points within that context.","Choreo handles configurations and secrets for different environments using its Environment feature. Here’s how it works:

1. **Environments**: Choreo allows you to create multiple environments (e.g., Development, Staging, Production) within a single project. Each environment can have its own set of configurations and secrets.

2. **Separate Configurations**: You can define different configurations for each environment. For example, you might use a different database URL or API endpoint in Staging compared to Production.

3. **Secure Storage**: Secrets like API keys, passwords, and other sensitive information are stored securely in Choreo. They are encrypted at rest and in transit, ensuring that they are protected from unauthorized access.

4. **Environment Variables**: You can manage environment-specific variables through Choreo's UI or via the API. This allows you to keep sensitive data out of your codebase and manage them securely.

5. **Access Control**: You can control who has access to view and modify these configurations and secrets. This is done through role-based access control (RBAC), ensuring that only authorized personnel can make changes.

By using Choreo’s environment management features, you can maintain separate and secure configurations for different environments without knowing that your sensitive data is well-protected.","You are a helpful assistant made to answer questions about the Choreo documentation.

What are the typical steps involved in a Choreo build pipeline?,"Choreo auto-generates build pipelines that generally include building a container image from the provided source code or a Dockerfile for a specific commit, running security and vulnerability scans (if applicable based on component type), pushing the container image to a container registry (Choreo-managed for cloud data plane, user-owned for private data plane), and updating service endpoints and API specifications from the provided repository (if applicable). Some buildpacks also support integrating unit tests.","A typical Choreo build pipeline consists of several key steps that facilitate the building and deployment of your components. Here's an overview of these steps:

1. **Build Container Image**: Choreo begins by building a container image either from the source code you've provided or from a specified Dockerfile for a specific commit.

2. **Security and Vulnerability Scans**: The build pipeline runs security and vulnerability scans, depending on the type of component being built. This ensures that the built image is secure before it is pushed to a registry.

3. **Push to Container Registry**: Once the image is built and scanned, it is pushed to a container registry. For a Choreo-managed cloud data plane, the image is stored in a registry managed by Choreo. If you're using a private data plane, the image is pushed to your own registry.

4. **Update Service Endpoints and API Specifications**: If applicable, the service endpoints and API specifications are updated based on the information provided in your repository.

5. **Integration of Unit Tests (Optional)**: Some buildpacks allow for the integration of unit tests into the build pipeline, enabling you to ensure that your code behaves as expected before deployment.

6. **Triggering Builds**: You can manually trigger a build from the Build page by clicking **Build Latest** or set up automatic builds on each commit by enabling the **Auto Build on Commit** feature.

7. **Build Logs**: You can view the logs of the builds on the Build page to check for any issues or confirmations of success.

These steps ensure a smooth transition from code to deployment, safeguarding the integrity and security of your applications throughout the process. For more detailed information, you can refer to the [Choreo Build documentation](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/ci-cd/#build).","A typical build pipeline in Choreo involves several key steps:

1. **Source Code Checkout**: The pipeline starts by checking out the latest version of the source code from a version control system (like Git).

2. **Build**: The code is compiled or built into an executable or deployable artifact. This step ensures that the code is syntactically correct and ready for deployment.

3. **Tests**: Automated tests are run to ensure that the application functions as expected. This includes unit tests, integration tests, and possibly end-to-end tests.

4. **Static Analysis**: Static analysis tools scan the code for potential issues such as security vulnerabilities, coding standards violations, or performance bottlenecks.

5. **Docker Image Build (if applicable)**: If your application uses Docker, the pipeline will build a Docker image that contains all necessary dependencies and configurations.

6. **Quality Gates**: The pipeline checks if all previous steps have passed successfully. If any step fails, the pipeline stops and notifies the team.

7. **Deployment**: Once all checks pass, the application is deployed to a staging or production environment. This can involve deploying to a cloud platform, container orchestration tool like Kubernetes, or a server.

8. **Monitoring and Logging**: After deployment, the application is monitored for performance and errors. Logs are collected and analyzed to ensure everything is running smoothly.

9. **Notifications**: Notifications are sent to relevant stakeholders (e.g., developers, operations teams) about the status of each step in the pipeline.

These steps help ensure that the application is reliable, secure, and performs well before it reaches production.","You are a helpful assistant made to answer questions about the Choreo documentation.

Can I integrate unit tests into the build process?,"Yes, some buildpacks in Choreo support integrating unit tests directly into the build pipeline. For more detailed information on how to do this, you can refer to the documentation on 'Integrate Unit Tests into the Build Pipeline'.","Yes, unit tests can be integrated into the build process in Choreo. This integration allows for code validation before deployment, ensuring that any changes are tested early and reducing the risk of defects in production. However, it's important to note that Choreo currently supports unit tests only for the `WSO2 MI` buildpack.

Here’s how you can integrate unit tests into your build pipeline:

### Step 1: Write Tests
You need to create unit tests within your source code using standard testing libraries. For specific instructions on creating unit tests for WSO2 Micro Integrator projects, you can refer to the guide on [Creating a Unit Test Suite](https://mi.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/develop/creating-unit-test-suite/).

### Step 2: Enable Unit Tests
1. In the **Component Listing** pane, click on the component for which you want to enable unit tests.
2. In the left navigation menu, click on **Build**.
3. On the **Build** page, click to edit **Build Configurations**.
4. Turn on the **Unit Test** toggle.
5. Click **Save**.

### Step 3: Trigger a New Build
- On the **Build** page, click **Build Latest**. This action will start a new build with the unit tests enabled, and you can monitor its progress in the **Build Details** pane.

### Viewing Failed Unit Tests
If a unit test fails during the build process, you can view detailed logs for troubleshooting. Click **View Details** corresponding to the failed build, and then expand the failed unit test step to access the logs.

For a practical example, you can explore the [WSO2 MI helloworld](https://github.com/wso2/choreo-samples/tree/main/hello-world-mi) sample to see unit tests in action within the build pipeline.

For more detailed information, you can refer to the documentation on [Integrate Unit Tests into the Build Pipeline](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/integrate-unit-tests-into-the-build-pipeline/).","Yes, you can integrate unit tests into the build process. Most build tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, CircleCI, and others support running tests as part of the build pipeline.

What are 'repeatable builds' in Choreo?,"Repeatable builds in Choreo mean that if you initiate multiple builds from the exact same Git commit, they will consistently generate Docker images with identical behavior. It's important to note that Choreo preserves only the most recent version of the Docker image created from a particular code version.","In Choreo, ""repeatable builds"" refer to the capability of the platform to replicate builds from an identical code version, specifically a Git commit. This means that if multiple builds are initiated from the same commit, Choreo will generate Docker images that behave the same way each time. This functionality ensures consistency across builds, which is critical for maintaining stability and reliability in deployment processes.

### Implementation of Repeatable Builds in Choreo

1. **Build Triggering**: You can initiate a build from the **Build** page in the Choreo console. There are options to build the latest version or select a specific commit to build an image from.
   
2. **Build Process**: During the build process, Choreo performs several steps:
   - It builds a container image from the source code or a Dockerfile associated with the selected commit.
   - Security and vulnerability scans may be carried out, depending on the component type.
   - The built image is then pushed to a container registry (either Choreo-managed or your own, if using a private data plane).
   - It updates service endpoints and API specifications as necessary.

3. **Image Management**: When multiple builds are triggered from the same code version, Choreo retains only the most recent Docker image created from that specific version. This means that any previous images from the same commit are replaced, which helps in managing storage and ensuring that only the latest build is used.

4. **Auto Build on Commit**: If you want to automate this process, you can enable the **Auto Build on Commit** feature, which triggers a build automatically with each commit made to the connected Git repository.

By leveraging these features, Choreo ensures that developers can achieve consistent and reliable deployments, making it easier to maintain applications over time.

For more detailed information, you can refer to the documentation: [Choreo CI/CD Build Documentation](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/ci-cd/#build).","In Choreo, repeatable builds refer to the process of creating consistent and reliable deployment packages for your applications services. This means that every time you build your application, the resulting package should be identical, ensuring that the same set of code and dependencies are used each time. This consistency helps in avoiding issues related to different builds producing slightly different results, which can lead to bugs or unexpected behavior in production. To achieve repeatable builds in Choreo, you typically configure your environment to use specific versions of libraries and tools, and automate the build process so that it follows a defined set of steps every time.","You are a helpful assistant made to answer questions about the Choreo documentation.

Are there any special considerations for deploying Ballerina components?,"Yes, for Ballerina components, you must trigger the very first build manually to ensure that Choreo applies the required configurations to the development environment; automatic builds can be enabled subsequently. Choreo also automatically checks the configurable values defined in your Ballerina source code against those applied in an environment during deployment and promotion. If you've changed the configurables, auto-build pipelines might fail as a precaution to prevent component crashes at runtime due to missing configurations. This configurable verifying capability is only available for Ballerina components. For Dockerfile-based components, you need to manually manage and update configurations and secrets in environments ahead of time and ensure backward compatibility.","When deploying Ballerina components in Choreo, there are several special considerations to keep in mind:

1. **Java Runtime Compatibility**: 
   - If you have created components using the Ballerina preset, it is highly recommended to redeploy your components before any infrastructure upgrades. This ensures that your component is built using the latest Java Runtime version, which is crucial for compatibility.

2. **Initial Deployment**: 
   - The first build of a Ballerina component must be triggered manually. This allows Choreo to apply the necessary configurations to the development environment. After this initial deployment, you can enable automatic builds and deployments.

3. **Configurable Management**: 
   - Choreo manages Ballerina configurables, allowing you to modify these configurables during deployment or promotion via the Deploy page. This is crucial because if you change any configurables, it may lead to failures in automatic build pipelines to prevent runtime crashes.

4. **Immutable Deployments**: 
   - Once a component is deployed with specific configurations, those configurations become immutable. Any subsequent changes will require a new deployment.

5. **Promoting Components**: 
   - Choreo builds a container once per GitHub commit, and you can promote it across higher environments from the Deploy page of a component.

6. **Backward Compatibility**: 
   - If you change the configurations in your Ballerina component, ensure backward compatibility with at least one previous release to avoid issues.

For more detailed steps on deploying Ballerina components in Choreo, including how to manage configurations and perform deployments, you can refer to the following documentation links:
- [Choreo Kubernetes Infrastructure Upgrade Notice](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/resources/kubernetes-upgrade-notice/#action-required)

What happens if I change configurations after a component is deployed?,"Once Choreo deploys a component with configurations, those configurations become immutable. Any subsequent change to these configurations will necessitate and result in a new deployment.","Changing configurations of a component in Choreo after deployment can have several effects depending on the type of configurations being modified. Here’s a breakdown of what happens with different types of configurations:

### Environment-independent Configurations
- **Definition**: These configurations apply to all environments.
- **Modification Process**: To change these configurations, you need to go to the **Deploy** page of the component, make the necessary changes via the **Set Up** card, and then trigger a new deployment. After that, you can promote the component to higher environments.
- **Effect**: Changing these configurations will result in a new deployment of the component, which may impact the behavior of the service across all environments where it is deployed.

### Environment-specific Configurations
- **Definition**: These configurations are specific to a particular environment.
- **Modification Process**: To change them, navigate to the **Deploy** page, make the necessary changes in the specific environment card, and trigger a new deployment.
- **Effect**: Similar to environment-independent configurations, modifying these configurations will also lead to a new deployment, affecting only the specified environment.

### Immutable Deployments
Once a component is deployed with certain configurations, those configurations become immutable. This means any change to the configurations will necessitate a new deployment. In essence, the existing deployment remains unchanged until you initiate a new deployment with updated configurations.

### Zero-downtime Deployments
Choreo ensures zero downtime between deployments and promotions through rolling updates. If you have set up health checks for your component, these checks will be performed on the new build before switching traffic from the current build, which helps maintain service availability.

### Summary
In summary, changing configurations of a component after deployment leads to a new deployment, which can impact the behavior of the component. It’s essential to ensure that any changes are thoroughly tested and that health checks are configured to avoid deploying unhealthy versions of the component.

For more detailed information on managing configurations, you can refer to the [Configuration Management document](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/ci-cd/#configurations).","When you change configurations after a component is deployed, the changes typically won't take effect immediately unless you restart or redeploy the component. Here’s what you need to do:

1. **Save Changes**: Ensure that you save all your configuration updates.
2. **Restart Component**: Often, you need to restart the component for the new configuration to apply. This can usually be done through the management interface or command-line tools provided by your platform.
3. **Redeploy (if necessary)**: In some cases, especially with more complex configurations, redeploying the component might be required to ensure all settings are correctly applied.

"How do I promote a component from one environment to another, like from development to production?","Choreo adopts a 'build once, deploy many' strategy, meaning a container is built once per GitHub commit and then promoted to subsequent higher environments. You can manually promote a component across environments by going to its **Deploy** page.","To promote a component from one environment to another in Choreo, you need to follow a structured process that involves requesting approval for the promotion. Here's how you can do it:

### Steps to Promote a Component

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Ensure that you have a component created, built, and deployed to the development environment.
   - Ensure that an approval workflow is configured for environment promotion.
   - Confirm that you are promoting the component to a critical environment, such as production.

2. **Request Approval**:
   - In the **Component Listing** pane, click on the component you want to promote. This will take you to the **Overview** page of the component.
   - In the left navigation menu, click on **Deploy**.
   - Go to the **Development** card and click **Request to Promote**.
   - In the **Request Approval** pane that opens, enter your request details and click **Submit**. This action creates a request and notifies all authorized assignees via email about the request.

3. **Approval Process**:
   - While the environment promotion request is pending review, Choreo restricts other developers from making the same request until the pending request is either approved or rejected.
   - Once an authorized assignee approves the request, you will receive a confirmation email, allowing you to proceed to promote the component to the target environment.

### Additional Information
- Choreo provides two default environments: development and production. You can promote your components within these environments.
- It is also possible to override configuration values specific to the target environment during the promotion process.

For more detailed information, you can refer to the relevant documentation on [Request approval for environment promotion](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/submit-and-manage-workflow-approval-requests/#request-approval-for-environment-promotion) and [Manage Environments](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/manage-environments/).","To promote a component from one environment (e.g., development) to another (e.g., production) in Choreo, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare the Component**: Ensure that the component is fully tested and ready for the production environment in the development environment.

2. **Export the Component**: Export the component from the development environment using the Choreo API or UI. This creates a package that can be imported into other environments.

"What's the difference between environment-independent and environment-specific configurations, and how do I manage them?","Choreo allows for both: **Environment-independent configurations** apply to all environments. To change these, go to the component's **Deploy** page, make the necessary changes via the **Set Up** card, and then trigger a new deployment to the initial environment before promoting the component to higher environments. **Environment-specific configurations** apply only to a particular environment. To change these, go to the component's **Deploy** page, make the necessary changes via the specific environment card, and then trigger a new deployment for that particular environment.","In Choreo, configurations are categorized into two types: **environment-independent configurations** and **environment-specific configurations**. Understanding the difference between these two types is crucial for effectively managing your application's settings across various environments.

### Environment-independent Configurations
- **Definition**: These configurations are applicable across all environments (e.g., development, staging, production). They are consistent and do not change regardless of the environment in which your service is deployed.
- **Management**: To change environment-independent configurations, you need to:
  1. Navigate to the **Deploy** page of your component.
  2. Make the necessary changes via the **Set Up** card.
  3. Trigger a new deployment to the initial environment.
  4. Afterward, you can promote the component to higher environments.

### Environment-specific Configurations
- **Definition**: These configurations are tailored for a specific environment. They allow you to customize settings that may vary depending on the environment's requirements.
- **Management**: To adjust environment-specific configurations, you should:
  1. Go to the **Deploy** page of your component.
  2. Make changes via the card associated with the specific environment.
  3. Trigger a new deployment to apply these changes.

### Guidance on Managing Configurations
- **Use Configuration Groups**: Choreo allows you to create Configuration Groups to manage reusable configurations across components. This ensures consistency and simplifies the management of configurations by linking them to components at deployment time. 
- **Secrets vs Configurations**: It's important to differentiate between configurations and secrets. While configurations can be read and updated, secrets are write-only and should be used for sensitive information, such as passwords or service credentials.

For more detailed information on managing configurations in Choreo, you can refer to the following documentation:
- [Configuration Management](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/configuration-management/)
- [Manage Configurations and Secrets](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/manage-configurations-and-secrets/#the-difference-between-configurations-and-secrets)
- [Manage Configuration Groups](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/manage-configuration-groups/)","Environment-independent configurations refer to settings that remain consistent across all environments (e.g., development, testing, staging, production). These configurations typically include things like database connection strings, API keys, or any other settings that don't change based on the environment.

Environment-specific configurations, on the other hand, vary depending on the environment. For example, you might have different URLs for your application in development versus production. Managing these can be crucial to ensure that your application behaves correctly in each environment.

Here’s how you can manage both types:

1. **Environment-Independent Configurations:**
   - Store these in a single configuration file or source that is shared across all environments.
   - Use version control systems like Git to manage changes.
   - Ensure these configurations are consistent across all environments to avoid discrepancies.

2. **Environment-Specific Configurations:**
   - Use environment variables or separate configuration files for each environment.
   - For example, you might have `config.development.json`, `config.test.json`, `config.staging.json`, and `config.production.json`.
   - Load the appropriate configuration file based on the current environment.
   - You can set these environment variables using tools like Docker, Kubernetes, or directly in your application setup script.

### Example Workflow

1. **Define Configuration Files:**
   - Create a `config` directory with environment-specific files:
     ```
     config/
     ├── development.json
     ├── test.json
     ├── staging.json
     └── production.json
     ```

2. **Use Environment Variables:**
   - Set environment variables in your deployment scripts or infrastructure as code (IAC) tools:
     ```sh
     export ENV=production
     ```

3. **Load Configuration:**
   - In your application, load the correct configuration file based on the environment variable:
     ```python
     import os
     import json

     env = os.getenv('ENV', 'development')
     config_file = f'config/{env}.json'

     with open(config_file, 'r') as file:
         config = json.load(file)
     ```

4. **Version Control:**
   - Keep all configuration files under version control to track changes and collaborate effectively.

Does Choreo ensure my application stays online during deployments or promotions?,"Yes, Choreo performs rolling updates to ensure zero downtime between deployments and promotions. A new build undergoes a health check before traffic is switched to it from the current build. By configuring the necessary health checks for your component, you can prevent the deployment and promotion of unhealthy versions.","Choreo handles deployments to ensure that applications remain online and experience no downtime during the process through a mechanism known as **zero-downtime deployments**. Here’s how it works:

1. **Rolling Updates**: Choreo performs rolling updates, meaning that instead of shutting down the entire application for an update, it updates the application incrementally. This ensures that parts of the application remain available while others are being updated.

2. **Health Checks**: Before switching traffic from the current build to the new build, Choreo conducts a health check. This step is crucial as it verifies the new build's functionality and readiness for production. If the health checks are not successful, the deployment can be halted, preventing any potential issues from affecting the live application.

3. **Configuration of Health Checks**: For a component, it’s important to configure the necessary health checks. This configuration helps in preventing the deployment of unhealthy versions of the component, ensuring that only stable and functional versions are promoted to production.

These features work together to minimize the risk of downtime during deployments, allowing for a smoother transition between versions of your applications.

For more detailed information on zero-downtime deployments in Choreo, you can visit the following documentation link: [Zero-downtime deployments](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/ci-cd/#zero-downtime-deployments).","Choreo itself does not directly ensure that your application stays online during deployments or promotions. However, it provides tools and features that can help achieve this goal. For example, you can use blue-green deployments or canary releases to minimize downtime. These methods involve deploying new versions of your application to a separate environment and then switching traffic to the new version without any disruption to users. 

To implement these strategies effectively, you might need to integrate Choreo with other services like Kubernetes for managing deployments or load balancers to route traffic. Additionally, monitoring and logging features in Choreo can help you detect and respond to issues quickly.

What are 'Connections' in Choreo and why would I use them?,"In Choreo, 'Connections' are a feature that allows you to integrate services you intend to deploy on Choreo with other services already on Choreo or with external resources. Their main purpose is to help you create integrated solutions by enabling communication between different services and resources.","In Choreo, **Connections** are a fundamental feature that allows you to integrate and share services, enhancing the efficiency of building applications. Connections enable you to link your service with other services on Choreo or even with external resources, facilitating the creation of integrated solutions.

### Types of Connections

1. **Component Connections**: 
   - These are defined at the component level and are exclusive to that specific component.
   - They are useful for connecting a component to a legacy service or other Choreo services.
   - If a component utilizes multiple Choreo services, connections can share the same OAuth application by using the same client ID and secret.

2. **Project Connections**: 
   - These connections are created at the project level and can be utilized by any component within that project.
   - They are ideal for sharing services like third-party APIs across multiple components in a project.
   - Project connections under the OAuth security scheme will also share the same OAuth application across all components that reuse them.

### Benefits of Using Connections

- **Reusability**: By creating connections, services can be reused across different components and projects, reducing duplication and saving time.
- **Ease of Maintenance**: The connection parameters can be set up to be loosely coupled with the service implementation. This means that changes to the connection parameters do not require changes in the service code, making it easier to maintain.
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Choreo dynamically injects connection parameter values into environment variables at runtime, ensuring flexibility in how services are connected.
- **Integrated Development**: Connections enable seamless integration of various services, making it easier to create complex applications that leverage multiple resources.

Overall, using connections in Choreo accelerates the development process and enhances the overall efficiency of building integrated applications.

For more detailed information on creating and using connections, you can refer to the documentation on [Connections](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/connections/).","In Choreo, a 'Connection' is a way to link two services or components together so they can exchange data or trigger each other. Think of it as a pipeline that allows data to flow from one service to another.

You would use Connections for several reasons:

1. **Data Flow**: To pass data from one service to another. For example, if you have a service that collects data and another that processes or stores it, you would connect them to ensure the data flows smoothly.

2. **Triggering Services**: To trigger one service based on an event from another. For instance, if you want a service to run automatically when a new message arrives in a queue, you can set up a connection to trigger it.

3. **Integration**: To integrate multiple services into a workflow. By connecting different services, you can create complex workflows where each step depends on the output of the previous one.

4. **Automation**: To automate processes by chaining services together. This helps in building robust and efficient automation pipelines.

How do I use a Connection in my service once it's created in Choreo?,"Once you create a connection, Choreo provides you with a Connection ID and a set of connection parameters. You then configure your service to establish a connection using this Connection ID and map the connection parameters to environment variable names within your Choreo component. Your service implementation can then read these environment variables to retrieve the values and create a programmatic connection to the desired service.","To use a Connection in your service after it has been created in Choreo, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add Connection Configurations
Integrate the connection into your service by modifying the `component.yaml` file of your service. Depending on the version of the `component.yaml` you are using, the steps will differ slightly.

#### For `component.yaml v1.1`:
1. Add the following snippet to the `component.yaml` file:
   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     connectionReferences:
     - name: <CONNECTION_NAME>
       resourceRef: <RESOURCE_IDENTIFIER>
   ```
   - Replace `<CONNECTION_NAME>` with the name of your connection.
   - Replace `<RESOURCE_IDENTIFIER>` with a unique identifier for the service being connected to.

2. If you have an existing `connectionReferences` section, append this configuration.

3. Upon deployment, Choreo will create a subscription if applicable, and the required configurations will be automatically injected into the Choreo-defined environment variables.

#### For `component.yaml v1.0` (Legacy):
1. Add the following snippet to the `component.yaml` file:
   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     serviceReferences:
     - name: <SERVICE_NAME>
       connectionConfig: <CONNECTION_ID>
       env:
       - from: ServiceURL
         to: <YOUR_ENV_VARIABLE_NAME_HERE>
       - from: ConsumerKey
         to: <YOUR_ENV_VARIABLE_NAME_HERE>
       - from: ConsumerSecret
         to: <YOUR_ENV_VARIABLE_NAME_HERE>
       - from: TokenURL
         to: <YOUR_ENV_VARIABLE_NAME_HERE>
       - from: ChoreoAPIKey
         to: <YOUR_ENV_VARIABLE_NAME_HERE>
   ```
   - Replace `<SERVICE_NAME>` with the name of the service you are connecting to, and `<CONNECTION_ID>` with the unique connection identifier.

2. Replace `<YOUR_ENV_VARIABLE_NAME_HERE>` with the names you want to use for the environment variables.

### Step 2: Read Configurations within the Application
You can access the connection parameters in your application code using environment variables. For instance, in Node.js, you would read the configurations as follows:
```javascript
const serviceURL = process.env.CHOREO_<CONNECTION_NAME>_SERVICEURL;
```

### Step 3: Acquire an OAuth 2.0 Access Token (if applicable)
If your service requires OAuth 2.0 authentication, you'll need to obtain an access token. You can do this by making a request to the token endpoint with your consumer key and secret.

### Step 4: Invoke the Service
Once you have the necessary configurations and access token, you can make HTTP requests to the connected service. Depending on your authentication method, the request may look like this:

- For API Key security:
```javascript
const response = await axios.get(`${serviceURL}/{RESOURCE_PATH}`, {
  headers: {
    'Choreo-API-Key': `${choreoApiKey}`
  }
});
```

- For OAuth 2.0:
```javascript
const response = await axios.get(`${serviceURL}/{RESOURCE_PATH}`, {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`
  }
});
```

By following these steps, you can successfully use a Connection in your service within Choreo.

For more detailed information, you can refer to the documentation here: [Use a Connection in Your Service](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/sharing-and-reusing/use-a-connection-in-your-service/).","Once you have created a Connection in Choreo, you can use it in your services by referencing its name and credentials. Here’s a simple guide:

1. **Identify the Connection**: Make sure you have the correct Connection name and its associated credentials (like API keys or tokens).

2. **Reference the Connection in Your Service**:
   - In the Choreo editor, when you create a new action or modify an existing one, look for the ""Connections"" section.
   - Select the appropriate Connection from the dropdown menu.

3. **Configure the Connection**:
   - After selecting the Connection, you might need to configure it further with specific parameters or settings required by the service.

4. **Use the Connection in Actions**:
   - Once configured, you can use the Connection in your actions to perform tasks that require external services or APIs.

For example, if you have a Connection named `MyAPIConnection` set up for accessing a third-party API, you would select this Connection in the relevant action within your service to authenticate and interact with that API.

What's the difference between Project Connections and Component Connections in Choreo?,"The primary difference lies in their visibility and scope. Project Connections are created at the project level and can be used by *any component* within that particular project. In contrast, Component Connections are defined at the individual component level and can only be used by *that specific component*.","In Choreo, there are two types of connections: Project Connections and Component Connections, each serving distinct purposes within your projects.

### Project Connections
- **Scope**: These connections are created at the project level.
- **Usage**: They can be utilized by any component within the same project. This makes it convenient to share services across multiple components.
- **Example**: If you need to integrate a third-party service like Twilio across various components in your project, you would create a Project Connection. All components can then refer to this connection using its connection ID.
- **OAuth Application**: When Project Connections are used to consume Choreo services under the OAuth security scheme, they share the same OAuth application, meaning all components using this connection will employ the same client ID and client secret.

For more details, you can refer to the [Project Connections documentation](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/connections/#project-connections).

### Component Connections
- **Scope**: These connections are defined at the individual component level.
- **Usage**: They are exclusive to the component in which they are created, meaning other components in the project cannot use them.
- **Example**: If you need a specific component to connect to a legacy service, you would create a Component Connection that only that component can utilize.
- **OAuth Application**: Similar to Project Connections, if a Component Connection consumes Choreo services under the OAuth security scheme, it can also share the same OAuth application by using the same client ID and secret among multiple Component Connections within the same component.

For additional information, you can check the [Component Connections documentation](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/connections/#component-connections).

### Summary of Differences
- **Visibility**: Project Connections are available to all components in a project, while Component Connections are limited to a single component.
- **Purpose**: Use Project Connections for shared services across multiple components; use Component Connections for service integrations specific to a single component.

These distinctions help in organizing and managing connections effectively in Choreo, ensuring that the right services are accessible to the appropriate components.","In Choreo, Project Connections and Component Connections serve different purposes:

1. **Project Connections**: These connections are used to link services or components within the same project. They allow you to define how different parts of your project interact with each other. For example, if you have multiple components in a project that need to communicate, you would use Project Connections to establish these internal relationships.

2. **Component Connections**: These connections are used to link services or components across different projects or within the same project but at a more granular level than Project Connections. They are typically used when you want to reference a specific component or service from another project or even from another part of the same project. This allows for more modular and reusable design patterns.

When should I use a Project Connection instead of a Component Connection? Can you give an example?,"You should use a Project Connection when you want to share a connection to a service or resource across multiple components within the same project. For example, if you want all components in your project to reuse a third-party service like Twilio, you would create a Project Connection for it. Components can then refer to this connection using its Connection ID.","In Choreo, there are two types of connections: **Project Connections** and **Component Connections**. Each serves a different purpose depending on the scope of usage within your projects.

### Project Connections
- **Definition**: Project Connections are created to connect to services within a specific project. These connections can be utilized by any component within that project.
- **Use Case**: If you have a third-party service, like Twilio, that you want to make available to all components in your project, you would create a Project Connection. This allows all components to reuse the same connection without needing to create individual connections for each component.
- **Example**: If you are building multiple microservices that all need access to the same external API, you can define a Project Connection for that API. All services can reference this single connection ID, simplifying management and reducing redundancy.

### Component Connections
- **Definition**: Component Connections, on the other hand, are defined at the component level and are only used by that specific component.
- **Use Case**: If a component requires a unique connection to a service that is not shared with other components, you would create a Component Connection. This is useful for services that are specific to a particular functionality or that do not need to be exposed to other components.
- **Example**: Consider a scenario where you have a legacy service that only one component needs to connect to. In this case, you would create a Component Connection specifically for that component, allowing it to interact with the legacy service without exposing that connection to other components in the project.

### Summary of Differences
- **Scope of Use**: 
  - Project Connections are reusable across all components within the same project.
  - Component Connections are limited to the specific component that created them.
  
- **Ideal Scenarios**:
  - Use **Project Connections** for shared resources or services that multiple components will use.
  - Use **Component Connections** for services or resources that are exclusive to a single component.

- [Component Connections](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/connections/#component-connections)","A Project Connection is used when you want to share data or resources between different components within the same project. A Component Connection, on the other hand, is used to connect a component to another component or service outside the project.

You should use a Project Connection when:
1. You need to share data or resources between components within the same project.
2. The components are part of the same project and you want to maintain a clean and organized project structure.

Example:
Imagine you have a project with two components: `WeatherDataFetcher` and `TemperatureConverter`. The `WeatherDataFetcher` retrieves weather data from an API, and the `TemperatureConverter` converts temperature units (e.g., Celsius to Fahrenheit). You can use a Project Connection to pass the retrieved weather data from `WeatherDataFetcher` to `TemperatureConverter` for processing. This way, both components remain part of the same project and can easily share data without the overhead of external connections.

Here's a simple representation:

```
Project: WeatherApp
Components:
- WeatherDataFetcher
- TemperatureConverter

Connection: Project Connection from WeatherDataFetcher to TemperatureConverter
```

In this scenario, using a Project Connection makes sense because both components are part of the same project and need to share data seamlessly.","You are a helpful assistant made to answer questions about the Choreo documentation.

When is it more appropriate to use a Component Connection?,"It's more appropriate to use a Component Connection when the connection is specific to a single component and doesn't need to be shared across the entire project. For instance, if only a particular component needs to connect to a legacy service, you would create a Component Connection for that specific integration.","In Choreo, **Component Connections** are designed for use at the component level, meaning they are utilized exclusively by a specific component. Here are some scenarios where it is more appropriate to use a Component Connection:

1. **Isolated Dependencies**: If your component requires a connection to a service (like a legacy service) that is not shared with other components, defining a Component Connection is ideal. This ensures the connection is tightly coupled with that specific component and does not affect or interfere with other components.

2. **Multiple Connections**: If your component needs to consume multiple Choreo services, you can create Component Connections for each service. Notably, if these services use the OAuth security scheme, they can share the same OAuth application by using the same client ID and secret, simplifying authentication management.

3. **No Cross-Component Sharing Needed**: When you do not intend for the connection to be reused across different components within the same project, a Component Connection is the best choice. This keeps your component's dependencies self-contained.

For example, if you are building a component that integrates with a specific database or an external API and you want to keep that integration unique to that component, using a Component Connection would be the most appropriate approach.

For more detailed information about Component Connections, you can refer to the documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/connections/#component-connections).","A Component Connection in Choreo is more appropriate when you want to directly link the output of one component to the input of another without they are closely related or part of the same workflow. This is useful for creating a more streamlined and efficient process where data flows seamlessly from one step to the next without there's no need for intermediate steps or transformations.

For example, if you have a series of components that perform sequential tasks like fetching data, processing it, and then storing it, connecting these components directly can simplify your workflow and improve performance by reducing the number of steps involved.","You are a helpful assistant made to answer questions about the Choreo documentation.

How do Project Connections handle OAuth security when shared across multiple components?,"For Project Connections created to consume Choreo services under the OAuth security scheme, they will share the same OAuth application across the project. This means any component reusing such a connection will use the same client ID and client secret.","In Choreo, when sharing Project Connections among multiple components, OAuth security is handled in a cohesive manner to streamline the authentication process across the various components. Here's how it works:

### Project Connections
- **Definition**: Project Connections are connections created to link to services within a specific project. These connections can be reused by any component within that project.
- **OAuth Application Sharing**: When Project Connections are set up to consume services secured with OAuth, they utilize a shared OAuth application across the project. This means that all components that refer to this Project Connection will use the same **client ID** and **client secret**.

### Benefits of Shared OAuth Security
1. **Simplified Management**: By sharing the same OAuth credentials (client ID and secret) across components, it simplifies the management of OAuth configurations. You don't need to manage separate credentials for each component.
2. **Consistent Security**: All components using the Project Connection will adhere to the same security policies defined by the OAuth application, ensuring consistent security practices throughout the project.

### Implementation Steps
- To set up a Project Connection with OAuth security:
  1. Create the Project Connection in the Choreo console.
  2. Configure it to consume the desired Choreo services with the OAuth scheme.
  3. Use the connection ID in your components to refer to this shared connection.

### Accessing Services
When a component needs to access a service through the Project Connection:
- It will authenticate using the shared client ID and client secret.
- The component can then make calls to the secured service without needing to implement the OAuth flow individually.

This approach enhances security and reduces complexity in managing OAuth tokens and credentials across multiple components.

For further details, you can refer to the documentation on Project Connections [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/connections/#project-connections).","Project Connections in Choreo use OAuth for secure authentication and authorization. When a Project Connection is shared across multiple components, the OAuth tokens and secrets are not directly shared. Instead, each component requests access to the resources through the Project Connection using its own set of credentials. This ensures that even if one component is compromised, the security of other components remains intact.

Here’s how it works in more detail:

1. **OAuth Token Generation**: When a user authenticates with an external service (e.g., Google, GitHub), an OAuth token is generated. This token is specific to the user and the service.

2. **Secure Storage**: The OAuth token is securely stored in the Project Connection settings within Choreo.

3. **Component Access**: Each component that needs to access the external service uses the Project Connection to request an OAuth token. This request includes the necessary scopes and credentials.

4. **Token Exchange**: The Project Connection handles the OAuth flow, exchanges the credentials for the token, and then securely provides this token to the requesting component.

5. **Token Usage**: The component uses the provided OAuth token to make API calls to the external service.

By following this process, Project Connections ensure that OAuth security is maintained even when multiple components share the same connection. This approach helps prevent unauthorized access and keeps sensitive information secure.","You are a helpful assistant made to answer questions about the Choreo documentation.

"If my component consumes multiple Choreo services, can Component Connections help with OAuth?","Yes, if your component consumes more than one Choreo service, the Component Connections created to consume those services under the OAuth security scheme can share the same OAuth application. This is achieved by sharing the same client ID and secret between all such connections within that specific component.","Yes, Component Connections in Choreo can facilitate OAuth authentication for components that consume multiple services. When you create Component Connections for your component to consume various Choreo services under the OAuth security scheme, you can reuse the same OAuth application by sharing the same client ID and secret across all such connections.

How do Deployment Tracks handle API versioning for service components in Choreo?,"For service components, Deployment Tracks facilitate effective API versioning by following a mechanism based on Semantic Versioning (SemVer), specifically using the major and minor versions with a 'v' prefix (e.g., `v1.2`). API developers only need to specify the major and minor versions being delivered from a particular deployment track, which is treated as the API version attribute. This approach helps minimize disruption for API consumers when updates are continuously deployed.","In Choreo, Deployment Tracks play a significant role in handling API versioning for service components by adopting a systematic approach aligned with Semantic Versioning (SemVer). Here's how it works:

### API Versioning Mechanism
Choreo uses a versioning mechanism that focuses on the major and minor version numbers of APIs, which are prefixed with `v`. For example, an API version could be represented as `v1.2`.

### Versioning Guidelines
When managing API versions in Choreo, the following guidelines should be adhered to:
- **Major Version Increment**: This should be done when there are incompatible changes made to the API.
- **Minor Version Increment**: This should be performed when new functionalities are added in a backward-compatible manner.

### Deployment Tracks and API Versioning
With Deployment Tracks, API developers only need to specify the major and minor versions being delivered from a particular deployment track. This specification functions as the API version attribute of that deployment track. Additionally, for internal tracking purposes, developers can utilize Git tags or GitHub releases to manage versioning.

Overall, the combination of Deployment Tracks and a clear versioning strategy helps reduce disruptions for API consumers while allowing for continuous development and deployment of updates.

For more detailed information, you can refer to the relevant documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/deployment-tracks/#efficient-api-versioning).","Deployment Tracks in Choreo help manage different versions of APIs for service components. Here’s how they handle API versioning:

1. **Versioned Endpoints**: Each version of an API is assigned a unique endpoint URL. For example, `api/v1` and `api/v2`.

2. **Track Configuration**: When setting up a Deployment Track, you specify which version of the API should be used for each track. This can be done through the Choreo UI or by modifying the configuration files.

3. **Routing Rules**: You define routing rules that map requests to specific tracks based on the API version requested in the request URL. For instance, requests to `api/v1` go to one track, while requests to `api/v2` go to another.

4. **Rolling Updates**: You can perform rolling updates between versions by switching the traffic from one track to another gradually. This helps in minimizing downtime and ensuring smooth transitions.

5. **Monitoring and Logging**: You can monitor and log requests to each track separately to track performance and usage patterns for different API versions.

By using Deployment Tracks, you can manage multiple versions of your APIs efficiently, allowing you to introduce new features or fix bugs without minimal impact on your users.","You are a helpful assistant made to answer questions about the Choreo documentation.

When should I increment the major versus the minor version of my API when using Deployment Tracks in Choreo?,"In Choreo's API versioning with Deployment Tracks, you should increment the major version when you introduce incompatible API changes. You should increment the minor version when you add new functionality in a backward-compatible manner. This aligns with the Semantic Versioning specification.","When using Deployment Tracks in Choreo for API versioning, the Semantic Versioning (SemVer) approach is employed, which focuses on managing major and minor versions effectively. Here's when to increment each version type:

### Incrementing Major and Minor Versions

1. **Major Version Increment**:
   - You should increment the **major version** when you introduce **incompatible API changes**. These changes may break existing client integrations, requiring consumers to update their implementations to remain compatible with the new version.
   - For example, if you change the structure of the API response or remove an endpoint, this would necessitate a major version change.

2. **Minor Version Increment**:
   - Increment the **minor version** when you add functionality in a **backward-compatible manner**. This means that existing clients can continue to function without any modifications while benefiting from new features.
   - For instance, adding a new endpoint or introducing optional parameters to existing endpoints would require a minor version increment.

### Version Format
In Choreo, the versioning format follows the pattern **`v{major}.{minor}`**, such as `v1.2`.

### Context of Deployment Tracks
When working with Deployment Tracks, only the major and minor versions need to be specified, as these serve as the version attributes for a deployment track. This design simplifies the management of API versions and improves the overall experience for both API creators and consumers.

For more information, you can refer to the documentation on efficient API versioning in Deployment Tracks: [Efficient API versioning](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/deployment-tracks/#efficient-api-versioning).","In Choreo, when using Deployment Tracks, you should increment the major version of your API when making incompatible changes that would break existing clients or contracts. Incompatible changes include adding mandatory fields, changing data types, or removing endpoints.

On the other hand, you should increment the minor version for backward-compatible changes such as adding new optional fields, improving performance, or fixing bugs without maintaining the same client behavior.

Here’s a simple way to remember:
- **Major Version**: When breaking changes occur.
- **Minor Version**: For all other changes that do not break compatibility.","You are a helpful assistant made to answer questions about the Choreo documentation.

"If Choreo's API versioning focuses on major and minor versions, how do I manage patch updates or internal version tracking?","While Choreo's API version attribute for deployment tracks focuses on major and minor versions (as these are typically what concern API consumers most), changes that don't introduce breaking or additive modifications are categorized as patch updates. These should ideally not disrupt API clients. For internal tracking purposes, such as managing patch versions or other granular releases, publishers can use external tools like Git tags, GitHub releases, or similar mechanisms.","Choreo manages API versioning using a system based on Semantic Versioning (SemVer), focusing primarily on the major and minor versions. Here's how it works:

1. **Versioning Mechanism**: In Choreo, the versioning format used is `vX.Y`, where `X` represents the major version and `Y` represents the minor version. 
   - Major versions are incremented when there are incompatible changes to the API.
   - Minor versions are incremented when new functionality is added in a backward-compatible manner.

2. **Patch Updates**: While the versioning system primarily focuses on major and minor versions, patch updates (which typically do not introduce breaking changes) can still be important from a consumer perspective. These patch updates are often categorized as changes that don’t require significant communication to API consumers, as they should ideally not disrupt their API clients.

3. **Deployment Tracks**: For deployment tracks, the API developer specifies only the major and minor versions. This means that when deploying a service, the versioning relevant to consumers is simplified to major and minor versions, ensuring that consumers are not affected by patch-level changes.

4. **Internal Version Tracking**: For internal version tracking or for more granular version control, developers can utilize Git tags and GitHub releases. This means that while the public-facing API uses major and minor versioning for clarity and consumer stability, developers can track all changes, including patch updates, using internal tools and methodologies.

5. **Marketplace Integration**: In the Choreo Marketplace, services are also displayed by their major version, ensuring that clients are always routed to the latest minor version available within that major version. This assists in maintaining continuity and stability for consumers while allowing developers to push minor updates.

By following this structured versioning approach, Choreo facilitates efficient API management that minimizes disruption for API consumers while allowing developers to manage their service versions effectively.

For more details on versioning in Choreo, you can refer to the relevant documentation here: [Efficient API versioning](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/deployment-tracks/#efficient-api-versioning) and [Service versioning in the Choreo Marketplace](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/choreo-marketplace/#service-versioning-in-the-choreo-marketplace).","Choreo's API versioning primarily uses major and minor versions to indicate breaking changes and new features, respectively. For managing patch updates or internal version tracking, you can use suffixes or qualifiers in the version string. Here’s how you can approach it:

1. **Use Suffixes**: Append a suffix to the version number to indicate patch updates or internal changes. For example:
   - `1.0.0` (major version)
   - `1.0.1-patch1` (patch update)
   - `1.0.2-internal2` (internal change)

2. **Qualifiers**: Use qualifiers like `-alpha`, `-beta`, or `-rc` (release candidate) to track development stages:
   - `1.0.0-alpha1` (alpha stage)
   - `1.0.0-beta2` (beta stage)
   - `1.0.0-rc3` (release candidate)

3. **Internal Tracking**: Maintain an internal version control system that tracks all changes, including minor bug fixes and internal improvements. This can help in managing patches without not affecting the public versioning.

By using these methods, you can effectively manage patch updates and internal version tracking while keeping the public API versioning clear and consistent.","You are a helpful assistant made to answer questions about the Choreo documentation.

What exactly is an Endpoint in Choreo?,"In Choreo, an Endpoint is a network-exposed function that resides within a component. Specifically, service and integration components expose one or more endpoints.","An **endpoint** in Choreo is defined as a network-exposed function that resides within a component. Each service or integration component can expose one or more endpoints, and each of these endpoints acts as a unique entry point into the service. This means that different endpoints can provide various interfaces for interacting with your service, such as REST and GraphQL endpoints.

### Role of Endpoints in API Management and Integrations

1. **API Exposure**: Endpoints are crucial for exposing services to other services, integrations, or applications. They detail how a service can be consumed, including specifics like port number, protocol, and schema (e.g., OpenAPI specification or GraphQL schema).

2. **Standardized Interaction**: By defining endpoints with specific attributes (such as port binding, protocol, and network visibility), Choreo enables standardized interaction with services. This ensures that other applications can easily discover and communicate with your service.

3. **API Management**: Choreo allows for API management at the endpoint level, enabling lifecycle management and configuration of security settings for each endpoint. This includes capabilities like throttling, analytics, and monitoring, ensuring that APIs are secure and manageable.

4. **Visibility Control**: Endpoints can be configured with different network visibility options (Project, Organization, Public), determining who can access them. This feature is vital for controlling access to your services and protecting sensitive information.

5. **Managed APIs**: When endpoints are exposed as managed APIs, they are subject to Choreo's API management features, including lifecycle management and security policies. This allows for full control over how the APIs are utilized, monitored, and maintained.

In summary, endpoints play a critical role in both API management and integrations by providing clear, structured access points to your services, facilitating standardized interactions, and enabling robust management features.

For more detailed information on configuring endpoints in Choreo, you can refer to the documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/endpoint/).","In Choreo, an Endpoint is a specific network location (URL) that your application or service uses to communicate with other services. Think of it as a doorway through which data can flow into or out of your system. Endpoints are crucial for defining how different parts of your application interact with external systems or services.

For example, if you have a web service that provides weather information, the URL that clients use to request this data would be considered an Endpoint in Choreo. Choreo uses these endpoints to route requests and responses between different services in your workflow.","You are a helpful assistant made to answer questions about the Choreo documentation.

"Do I need to provide a service contract for an endpoint in Choreo, and what happens if I don't?","Each endpoint in a component can have a service contract, such as OpenAPI or GraphQL SDL, associated with it. This contract is used to expose the endpoint to consumers. If a contract is not provided, Choreo uses `/* exposed on all HTTP verbs` as the default contract to expose the service or integration.","In Choreo, providing a service contract for an endpoint is optional, but it is highly recommended. Each endpoint in a component can have a service contract (such as OpenAPI or GraphQL SDL) associated with it, which serves to define how consumers can interact with the endpoint. 

If you choose not to provide a service contract, Choreo defaults to a general contract represented by `/*` exposed on all HTTP verbs. This means that while the endpoint will still be accessible, it will lack the specificity and structured guidance that a proper service contract offers. This can lead to confusion for consumers regarding how to properly interact with the endpoint, as they won’t have a clear understanding of the expected request and response formats.

In summary:
- **Service Contract**: Defines how consumers interact with an endpoint.
- **Default Behavior**: If not provided, Choreo uses a generic contract, which may not be as informative for users of the service.

For more detailed information on configuring endpoints and the importance of service contracts, you can refer to the documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/endpoint/).","In Choreo, providing a service contract (also known as a WSDL or OpenAPI specification) for an endpoint is optional but highly recommended. 

If you don't provide a service contract:
- Choreo may not fully understand the capabilities and structure of the endpoint.
- You might miss out on automated testing and validation features that rely on the contract.
- Manual configuration and troubleshooting might become more complex.

However, if no contract is provided, Choreo can still allow you to test and interact with the endpoint manually. It's just that some advanced features might not work as expected.","You are a helpful assistant made to answer questions about the Choreo documentation.

How does Choreo handle API management for endpoints? Can I manage each endpoint separately?,"Yes, Choreo considers each endpoint exposed in a component as a single API. This allows you to perform API management per endpoint for a given component.","Choreo provides a robust API management system that allows you to manage API endpoints effectively, including the capability to handle each endpoint separately. Here’s how Choreo handles API management for endpoints:

### Endpoint Definition
In Choreo, an **endpoint** is a network-exposed function that resides within a component, such as a service or integration component. Each component can expose multiple endpoints, which can represent different entry points into that service. This includes various types such as REST APIs and GraphQL endpoints.

### API Management Features
1. **Service Contracts**: Each endpoint can be associated with a service contract (like OpenAPI or GraphQL SDL). If no contract is provided, Choreo defaults to exposing all HTTP verbs with a wildcard (`/*`).

2. **Lifecycle and Security Management**: Choreo enables lifecycle management and security configurations on a per-endpoint basis. This means you can manage individual endpoints according to your needs, providing flexibility in how they are deployed and accessed.

3. **Network Visibility**: The visibility of each endpoint can be configured to be project-specific, organization-specific, or public. This determines who can access the endpoint and how.

4. **Expose Endpoints as Managed APIs**: For security and controlled access, endpoints can be exposed as managed APIs through the Choreo API Gateway. This feature allows you to utilize full lifecycle API management, API throttling, secure authorization flows, and analytics for each endpoint.

5. **API Key Management**: Once an endpoint is exposed as a managed API, you can create and manage API keys for secure access. This management can be performed through the Choreo Developer Portal, where you can monitor and control API access effectively.

### Conclusion
In summary, Choreo facilitates detailed API management for each endpoint, allowing you to customize security, lifecycle, and exposure settings individually. If you want to configure endpoints or learn more about API management features, you can refer to the following documentation:

- [Configure Endpoints](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/configure-endpoints)

What kind of API management tasks can I perform for an individual endpoint in Choreo?,"For each individual endpoint in a component, Choreo allows you to perform tasks such as lifecycle management and configuring security settings.","In Choreo, you can perform several API management tasks for an individual endpoint. Here’s a comprehensive list of these tasks:

1. **Lifecycle Management**: Manage the lifecycle of the API endpoint, which includes various states such as created, pre-released, published, blocked, deprecated, and retired. This helps ensure that subscribers have access to the latest and most reliable APIs.

2. **Security Settings**: Configure security settings for the endpoint, which may include setting up role-based access control to restrict or allow certain users or roles to access the API.

3. **Expose as Managed API**: You can expose the endpoint as a managed API by setting its network visibility to either Organization or Public. This allows the endpoint to be accessible through the Choreo API Gateway, enabling full lifecycle API management, API throttling, analytics, and monitoring.

4. **API Key Management**: Generate and manage API keys for secure access to the endpoint. This includes actions such as regenerating or deleting API keys associated with the API.

These tasks enable effective management of APIs and ensure that they are secure, accessible, and optimized for subscribers.

Where can I find more detailed instructions on configuring endpoints when developing components in Choreo?,You can learn how to configure endpoints when developing components in Choreo by referring to the 'Configure Endpoints' documentation.,"To configure endpoints while developing components in Choreo, you have a couple of options depending on the buildpack you are using.

### Configuring Endpoints

1. **Automatic Detection**:
   - For `Ballerina` and `WSO2 MI` buildpacks, Choreo automatically detects the endpoint details for REST APIs.

2. **Manual Configuration**:
   - For other buildpacks (Java, Python, NodeJS, Ruby, PHP, Go, Dockerfile, etc.), you can configure endpoints in one of the following ways:
   - **Using the Choreo Console**: If a `component.yaml` file is not present, you can define a basic endpoint configuration during component creation.
   - **Using the `component.yaml` file**: You can manually configure endpoint details by defining them in a `component.yaml` file, which should be placed inside the `.choreo` directory at the build context path and committed to your source repository. This `component.yaml` file will take priority over other configurations.

   - **Dynamic Parameters**: If you need to define dynamic endpoint parameters (like variable ports), you must use a `component.yaml` file, as automatic endpoint generation does not support such parameters.

### Additional Endpoint Configuration File
- Choreo also supports an `endpoints.yaml` file for defining multiple endpoint configurations. This file should be placed in the `.choreo` directory and includes necessary attributes such as version, name, port, type, network visibility, context, and schema file path for the endpoints.

### Example Structure of `endpoints.yaml`
```yaml
version: 0.1
endpoints:
- name: Your Service
  port: 9090
  type: REST
  networkVisibility: Project
  context: /your-service
  schemaFilePath: your_service_openapi.yaml
```

What are environments in Choreo and why are they used?,"In Choreo, environments are designated spaces within a data plane where you can run your applications. They are used to manage and deploy applications through different stages, such as development, testing, and production.","In Choreo, environments serve as isolated deployment areas for your applications and components. Each project can utilize one or more environments, which helps manage and segregate the different stages of your application lifecycle, such as development, testing, and production.

### Purpose of Environments:
1. **Isolation**: Each environment is isolated, meaning services deployed in one environment cannot communicate with those in another. This ensures that changes in one environment do not affect others, which is particularly useful for testing new features without impacting production.

2. **Configuration Management**: Environments allow you to maintain separate configuration values and secrets specific to each deployment stage. For instance, while promoting a component from development to production, you can override certain configuration values to suit the production environment.

3. **Streamlined CI/CD**: Choreo supports a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) process, enabling you to build your application once and deploy it across multiple environments. This means you can test your application in lower, non-production environments before promoting it to production.

4. **Default Environments**: By default, Choreo provides two environments—development and production. However, users in a private data plane can create and customize additional environments based on their specific needs.

5. **Secure Storage**: All configurations and secrets stored at the environment level are encrypted and managed securely, ensuring that sensitive information is protected.

1. **Isolate Settings**: Different environments (e.g., development, testing, production) can have their own unique settings without being mixed with each other.

2. **Manage Secrets**: You can store sensitive information like API keys or database credentials in environment-specific settings, keeping them secure and separate from code.

3. **Configure Resources**: Each environment can have its own set of resources, such as databases or external services, tailored to the needs of that specific deployment stage.

4. **Test Changes**: Before deploying changes to production, you can test them in a staging environment to ensure everything works as expected.

5. **Scale Resources**: You can configure different scaling policies for resources in various environments based on their usage patterns.

How do I move my application components between different environments in Choreo?,You can move your application components between environments by 'promoting' them within a project across the available environments.,"In Choreo, moving or migrating application components between different environments is achieved through a process known as promotion. Here’s a comprehensive overview of how to manage this process:

1. **Understanding Environments**: Choreo provides isolated environments for each project, which can include development, staging, and production. Each environment is designed to have restricted network and resource access, ensuring that services in one environment cannot communicate with services in another.

2. **Build Once, Deploy Many Strategy**: When you create a component, it is built once per commit (if automatic builds are enabled) or based on a selected commit during manual builds. After building, you can promote this component to other environments as needed. This allows for testing in lower environments (like development) before moving to production.

3. **Environment-Specific Configurations**: When promoting a component, you have the option to override its configuration values with environment-specific values. This means you can customize the behavior of the component for each environment it is deployed in.

4. **Promotion Process**:
   - You start by deploying the component to the initial environment, typically development.
   - Once the component is successfully deployed and tested, you can promote it to the next environment (e.g., staging or production).
   - To promote a component, navigate to the relevant section in the Choreo console where you can manage deployments and trigger the promotion.

5. **Configuration Management**: You can define both environment-independent and environment-specific configurations. 
   - **Environment-independent configurations**: These are applicable across all environments and can be modified from the Deploy page of the component.
   - **Environment-specific configurations**: These are tailored for each environment and can also be modified from the Deploy page.

What is an organization in Choreo and why is it important for new users?,"An organization in Choreo is a logical grouping of users and their associated resources. It's crucial for first-time users because they must create an organization and be a member of it when signing in to Choreo. This structure also dictates access, as users and resources within one organization cannot access resources in another unless an admin of the other organization explicitly invites them and adds them as a member.","An organization in Choreo is essentially a logical grouping of users and user resources. For new users, creating an organization is a crucial first step upon signing into Choreo. Here are the key points regarding organizations and their importance:

1. **Creation Requirement**: First-time users are required to create an organization and become a member of it when they sign in to Choreo. This is a necessary step to start using the platform effectively.

2. **Resource Access**: Users and resources within an organization cannot access resources from another organization unless they are invited and added as members by an admin of that other organization. This ensures that resources are securely managed and shared only among authorized users.

3. **Single Organization Limitation**: Each user can create and belong to only one organization. This limitation emphasizes the importance of organizing resources and users effectively from the outset.

Creating an organization helps in managing your resources, collaborating with team members, and ensuring that the access to those resources is controlled and secure.

For more details, you can refer to the documentation on organizations [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/organization/).","In Choreo, an organization is a container that groups related services and resources together. It helps to organize and manage different components of your workflow or application.

For new users, understanding organizations is important because:

1. **Namespace**: Each organization acts as a namespace, helping to avoid naming conflicts between different services or resources.
2. **Permissions**: Organizations allow you to set permissions and access controls, ensuring that only authorized users can access certain services or resources.
3. **Resource Management**: They help in managing and organizing resources like services, workflows, and other assets in a structured manner.
4. **Team Collaboration**: If you're working in a team, organizations can be used to separate different teams' workspaces, making collaboration more organized and efficient.

So, when you start using Choreo, creating an organization to structure your projects and manage access effectively.","You are a helpful assistant made to answer questions about the Choreo documentation.

How does Choreo manage user permissions?,Choreo manages user permissions through a system that utilizes both groups and roles.,"Choreo manages user permissions and access control through a structured system that utilizes **Groups**, **Roles**, and a **Mapping level**. Here’s a detailed explanation of how this works:

### Groups
A group in Choreo is essentially a collection of users that can be assigned specific roles. Users within a group inherit the permissions associated with the roles assigned to that group. For example, if a user is part of the `API Publisher` group, they will automatically obtain the permissions associated with the API Publisher role.

Choreo has predefined groups with specific roles, including:
- **API Publisher**: Users who can create, publish, delete, and manage APIs.
- **API Subscriber**: Developers who can manage subscriptions and generate API keys.
- **Admin**: Users responsible for administration tasks including user management and project management.
- **Billing Admin**: Users who manage billing and subscriptions.
- **Choreo DevOps**: Users who manage deployment and monitor components.
- **Developer**: Users who develop and manage applications.
- **External API Subscriber**: API consumers with limited access to the Developer Portal.

### Roles
Roles in Choreo define the permissions associated with different user actions. Some key roles include:
- **API Publisher**: Can manage APIs.
- **API Subscriber**: Can manage subscriptions and applications.
- **Admin**: Has full administrative rights.
- **Developer**: Can develop and manage applications.

### Access Control
Choreo employs a mapping level for access control:
- **Organization Level**: Assigning a role to a group at the organization level grants that group permissions across all organizational resources. 
- **Project Level**: Assigning a role to a group at the project level restricts permissions to that specific project.

This hierarchical structure allows for precise control over what users can do based on their roles and the context of the projects they are involved in.

### Important Considerations
- It is recommended to assign only one role to a user across projects or levels to avoid unintended access. 
- Organization-level permissions take precedence over project-level permissions, meaning that a user with organization-level access can perform actions across all projects within that organization.

For a visual aid on how access control is structured, you can refer to the diagram provided in the documentation.

For detailed steps on managing user permissions and access control, you can check the following links:
- [Manage user permission](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/organization/#manage-user-permission)
- [Control Access in the Choreo Console](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/administer/control-access-in-the-choreo-console/)","Choreo manages user permissions through its Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system. Here’s how it works:

1. **Roles**: Choreo defines different roles that grant specific permissions. For example, there might be roles like ""Admin"", ""Developer"", and ""Viewer"".

2. **Assigning Users to Roles**: Users are assigned to these roles based on their responsibilities. For instance, developers might be assigned to the ""Developer"" role, while administrators would have the ""Admin"" role.

3. **Permissions**: Each role has predefined sets of permissions. For example, the ""Admin"" role might have full access to all features, while the ""Developer"" role might only have access to certain APIs or endpoints.

4. **Customization**: You can customize roles and permissions to fit your specific needs. This allows you to control exactly what each user can do within Choreo.

By using this RBAC system, Choreo ensures that users only have access to the parts of the platform they need, enhancing security and efficiency.","You are a helpful assistant made to answer questions about the Choreo documentation.

"What is a group in Choreo, and how do users inherit permissions from them?","A group in Choreo is a collection of users, where each user has one or more roles assigned to them. Users who are part of a group automatically inherit the permissions associated with the roles assigned to that specific group. For example, if you're added to the `API Publisher` group, you will automatically receive the `API Publisher` role.","In Choreo, a **group** is defined as a collection of users who are assigned one or more roles. These roles dictate the permissions that users within the group inherit. This means that when a user is added to a group, they automatically receive the permissions associated with the roles assigned to that group. For example, if a user is part of the `API Publisher` group, they will inherit the capabilities of the `API Publisher` role.

Choreo includes several predefined groups, each configured with specific roles, such as:
- **API Publisher**: Users can create, publish, and manage APIs.
- **API Subscriber**: Users can manage subscriptions and generate API keys.
- **Admin**: Users handle all administrative tasks, including user management and project oversight.
- **Billing Admin**: Users manage billing-related tasks.
- **Choreo DevOps**: Users manage deployments and monitor components.
- **Developer**: Users develop and manage cloud-native applications.
- **External API Subscriber**: Users consume APIs without broader access.

When creating a new group, it's important to assign a role to ensure that users within that group have the necessary permissions. 

### Permission Inheritance
Users inherit permissions based on the role assigned to their group as follows:
- If a role is assigned at the **organization level**, users inherit those permissions across all resources within the organization.
- If a role is assigned at the **project level**, users inherit permissions only within the context of that specific project.

For example, if a user has `edit_project` permissions assigned at the organization level, they can edit all projects within that organization. Conversely, if the same permission is assigned at the project level, the user can only edit that specific project.

It is advisable to avoid assigning multiple roles to a single user across different projects or levels to prevent unintended access.

For further details, you can refer to the documentation on [Managing User Permissions](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/organization/#manage-user-permission) and [Controlling Access in the Choreo Console](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/administer/control-access-in-the-choreo-console/).","In Choreo, a group is a collection of users who share similar access levels or permissions within the system. Users can be assigned to one or more groups, and the permissions set for those groups are automatically inherited by the users.

For example, if you create a group called ""Developers"" and assign it permission to view and edit workflows, all users added to this group will have those same permissions without without needing individual permission assignments.

To summarize:
- Groups organize users with common permissions.
- Users inherit permissions from the groups they belong to.
- This simplifies permission management by applying settings at the group level rather than managing permissions individually for each user.","You are a helpful assistant made to answer questions about the Choreo documentation.

What exactly is a 'project' in Choreo?,"In Choreo, a project is defined as a logical group of related components that typically represent a single cloud-native application.","In Choreo, a **project** is defined as a logical group of related components that typically represent a single cloud-native application. Its key characteristics include:

- **Composition**: A project can consist of one or more components. These components can ideally be stored in a single GitHub repository, organized under different paths, which is referred to as a monorepo architecture.

- **Deployment**: At deployment time, all components within a project are deployed into a single namespace in a Kubernetes cluster. This allows for streamlined management and deployment of the related components.

- **Exposure**: Components within a project can be exposed in different ways—publicly to the internet, internally to the organization, or privately within the project itself.

- **Architecture Representation**: A project is represented as a cell in the cell-based architecture of Choreo. 

### Components of a Project
Each **component** within a project serves as a unit of work in the application. Common types of components include:
- Microservices
- APIs
- Jobs/Tasks

Each component is linked to a specific directory in a Git repository, containing either the program's source code or a Dockerfile with build instructions. Components can be independently deployed, managed, and scaled, and they map to individual pods in the Kubernetes environment upon deployment.

### Purpose
The primary purpose of a project in Choreo is to organize and manage related components effectively, enabling users to build, deploy, and maintain cloud-native applications.

For more details about projects and components in Choreo, you can refer to the following documentation links: 
- [Project](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/project/)

This setup is also known as the monorepo architecture.","Yes, a single GitHub repository can be used for all components within a Choreo project. This setup is often referred to as a ""monorepo"" architecture, where multiple components are stored in a single repository under different paths.

### Configuration Steps

1. **Connect Your GitHub Repository**: 
   To use a single GitHub repository for all components, you need to connect the repository to your Choreo project. This involves authorizing the Choreo Apps GitHub application to access your repository.

2. **Create Components**:
   When creating components in Choreo, you specify the **Component Directory** for each component, which determines where in the repository's structure the component's source code resides. You can set different paths for different components within the same repository.

3. **Component Deployment**:
   At deployment time, all components within the project will be deployed into a single Kubernetes namespace. This means you can manage and deploy them collectively while still keeping their code organized in a single repository.

4. **Accessing the Repository**:
   You'll need to grant the necessary permissions to Choreo to read from and write to your GitHub repository. This is essential for tasks such as pulling updates and deploying changes.

### Example Structure
If you have a repository structured as follows:
```
/my-repo
    /component1
        (source code for component 1)
    /component2
        (source code for component 2)
```
You can configure both components within Choreo to point to their respective directories.

For detailed steps on connecting your repository and creating components, you can refer to the following documentation: [Choreo Project Documentation](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/project/) and [Develop Components with Git](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/develop-components-with-git/).","Yes, you can use a single GitHub repository for all components within a Choreo project.

Where are the components of a Choreo project deployed in a Kubernetes cluster?,"At deployment time, all components within a given project are deployed into a single namespace of the Kubernetes cluster.","The components of a Choreo project are deployed within a Kubernetes cluster in a specific way. When you deploy a project in Choreo, all components associated with that project are deployed into a single namespace of the Kubernetes cluster. This means that each component operates within a designated area, allowing for organization and isolation of resources.

Each component itself is represented as a single unit of work, such as a microservice or API, and maps to a single pod in the Kubernetes cluster. This allows for independent management and scaling of each component. 

To summarize:
- **Deployment Location**: All components of a project are deployed into a single namespace in the Kubernetes cluster.
- **Component Representation**: Each component corresponds to a single pod within that namespace.

For further details, you can refer to the following documentation:
- [Project Documentation](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/project/)
- [Component Documentation](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/component/)","In a Kubernetes cluster, the components of a Choreo project are typically deployed as Kubernetes resources such as Deployments, StatefulSets, or DaemonSets, depending on the specific requirements of the application. These resources are defined in YAML files that describe the desired state of the application and are applied using `kubectl` commands or through a Kubernetes API.

For example, a Deployment might include multiple containers running different services (like a web server and a database), each with its own set of resources like CPU and memory limits. The components are then managed by the Kubernetes scheduler and controller manager, ensuring they run as specified and are resilient to failures.

What are the different ways components within a Choreo project can be exposed?,"Components within a project can be exposed to the public internet, internally to the rest of the organization, or privately within the project only.","In Choreo, components within a project can be exposed in several ways, depending on their intended use and audience. Here are the different methods to expose components:

1. **Public Exposure**: Components can be exposed to the public internet, allowing external users or applications to access them. This is useful for APIs or services that need to be available to a wide audience.

2. **Internal Exposure**: Components can be made available internally within the organization. This method is suitable for services or applications that should only be accessed by users or systems within the same organization.

3. **Private Exposure**: Components can also be restricted to be accessible only within the project itself. This is ideal for internal components that do not need to be exposed to either the public internet or other internal systems.

Each of these exposure methods allows you to manage how your components interact with users or other systems, providing flexibility based on security and accessibility needs.

For more details, you can refer to the [Project documentation](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/project/) which elaborates on the structure and exposure of components within a Choreo project.","In Choreo, components within a project can be exposed in several ways:

1. **API Endpoints**: Components can expose their functionality as RESTful APIs. This allows other services or applications to interact with them using HTTP requests.

2. **Webhooks**: Components can also expose webhooks, which are callback URLs that notify external systems when certain events occur in the component.

3. **Message Queues**: Components can publish messages to message queues (like RabbitMQ or Kafka) for other components to consume. This is useful for asynchronous communication.

4. **Event Streams**: Some components might expose event streams, allowing real-time data to be pushed to subscribers.

5. **GraphQL Endpoints**: For more complex data retrieval needs, components can expose GraphQL endpoints, providing a flexible and efficient way to query data.

6. **Direct Method Calls**: Components can expose methods that can be called directly from other components within the same project or even across projects if properly configured.

Does a Choreo project align with any specific architectural pattern?,"Yes, a project in Choreo is represented as a cell with regard to the Cell-based architecture.","A Choreo project serves as a logical grouping of related components, which typically aligns with a cloud-native application architecture. Each project can contain one or more components, and they can be organized within a single GitHub repository, a structure often referred to as the **monorepo architecture**. 

Additionally, Choreo projects are represented as **cells** in a **cell-based architecture**, allowing for runtime isolation through namespaces during deployment. This means that all components within a project are deployed into a single namespace within the Kubernetes cluster, enhancing organizational efficiency and governance.

In summary, a Choreo project aligns closely with the monorepo architectural pattern and the cell-based architecture, emphasizing the organization, deployment, and management of related components in a cohesive manner.

How are data planes structured and shared within Choreo?,"Data planes in Choreo are connected to your organization and are accessible to all projects within that organization. When you create an environment in a project, the data plane linked to the organization is automatically associated with a newly generated Kubernetes namespace.","Choreo's architecture consists of two main components: the control plane and the data plane. Here's a detailed explanation of the structure and sharing mechanism of data planes within Choreo:

### Structure of Data Planes

1. **Control Plane**: 
   - The control plane is responsible for managing organizations, users, projects, and the overall application development journey, including deployment and governance.

2. **Data Plane**:
   - The data plane is where user applications are deployed based on configurations set in the control plane. It supports various application types, including services, web applications, APIs, integrations, and scheduled tasks. 
   - Traffic related to the runtime of these applications is contained within the data plane, ensuring that user data remains secure.

3. **Types of Data Planes**:
   - **Cloud Data Planes**: Utilize a multi-tenanted infrastructure model, allowing multiple users to share a secure environment for application runtime.
   - **Private Data Planes (PDPs)**: Offer dedicated infrastructure for a single organization, enhancing privacy and control over application deployments.

### Sharing Mechanism

- **Connectivity**:
  - The private data plane communicates with the control plane for various activities. All communications are outbound from the private data plane, which means there is no need to configure specific inbound traffic for these interactions. However, if outbound traffic is restricted, organizations must allow traffic to the public IP range of the control plane.

- **Management Models**:
  - Choreo offers several management models for private data planes, enabling collaboration between WSO2 and customers:
    - WSO2 fully managed (infrastructure and PDP in WSO2 subscription)
    - WSO2 fully managed (infrastructure and PDP in customer subscription)
    - Customer self-managed (installation script and updates provided by WSO2)

- **Data Privacy and Compliance**:
  - Logs and observability data are retained within the data plane, supporting data locality and compliance with regulations such as GDPR. This approach minimizes data exposure points and ensures that users have transparency and control over their data.

- **Resource Hierarchy**:
  - Data planes are connected to organizations and are available for all projects within that organization. When an environment is created in a project, it is linked to the data plane associated with the organization, which is reflected in a Kubernetes namespace.

### Summary

In summary, Choreo's data planes are designed to provide secure, efficient runtime environments for user applications, with distinct types of data planes catering to different organizational needs. The sharing mechanism ensures that organizations can manage and deploy their applications while maintaining control and compliance with data privacy regulations.

For more detailed information about data planes in Choreo, you can refer to the following documentation links:
- [Data Planes](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/data-planes/)
- [Private Data Plane Management Models](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/references/private-data-plane-management-models/)
- [Resource Hierarchy](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/resource-hierarchy/#organizations-and-data-planes)","In Choreo, data planes are structured and shared through the use of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) and workflows. Here’s how it works:

1. **APIs**: Each API in Choreo represents a service or resource that can be accessed programmatically. APIs define the endpoints, methods, and data formats that applications components can use to communicate with each other.

2. **Workflows**: Choreo uses workflows to manage the flow of data between different services and APIs. A workflow can orchestrate multiple APIs and services to perform complex operations. Workflows can be designed to handle data processing, transformation, and routing.

3. **Shared Data**: Data is shared between different parts of the system via these APIs and workflows. For example, when one service needs data from another, it can call an API endpoint provided by the other service. The response from this API call can then be used as input for further processing within the same workflow or passed to another service.

4. **Choreo Environment**: All these interactions happen within the Choreo environment, which provides a secure and managed space for developing, testing, and deploying microservices and APIs.

By structuring data planes in this way, Choreo enables efficient and scalable communication and data sharing among various components of a distributed application.","You are a helpful assistant made to answer questions about the Choreo documentation.

Where do components reside within the Choreo project structure?,"Components in Choreo belong to a specific project. Environments are also provisioned on a per-project basis, meaning each project has its own set of environments.","In Choreo, components reside within a project structure, which is a logical grouping of related components that typically represent a single cloud-native application. Here’s how it works:

1. **Project Structure**: A project can consist of one or more components, which can ideally be located in a single GitHub repository under different paths. This approach is known as the monorepo architecture.

2. **Deployment**: At deployment time, all components within a project are deployed into a single namespace of the Kubernetes cluster. This means that they can be managed and scaled as a unit, yet each component can also be deployed, managed, and scaled independently.

3. **Component Types**: Each component represents a single unit of work, such as a microservice, API, or job/task. Components are associated with specific directory paths in a Git repository, which contain either the program source code or a Dockerfile with build instructions.

4. **Environment Association**: Components belong to environments that are provisioned per project. When deployed, they exist within the specified environment, allowing for promotion across various environments as needed.

5. **Access**: Components can be exposed publicly, internally within the organization, or kept private within the project, depending on the requirements.

For more detailed information on the project structure and components, you can refer to the following documentation links:

- [Components and Environments](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/resource-hierarchy/#components-and-environments)","In the Choreo project structure, components reside in the `components` folder. This folder contains all the individual pieces or modules that make up your Choreo application.

How do I deploy a component to an environment in Choreo?,"When you deploy a component in Choreo, it is deployed as a container to a specified environment within your project.","To deploy a component to an environment in Choreo, follow these steps:

1. **Create and Build Your Component**: Ensure that you have a component created and built in your Choreo project.

2. **Deploy the Component**:
   - Navigate to the **Deploy** page of your component in the Choreo Console.
   - You can deploy the component in two ways:
     - **Manual Deployment**: Go to the **Set Up** card and click on **Deploy** to manually initiate the deployment.
     - **Automatic Deployment**: If you want the component to automatically deploy on build, enable the **Auto Deploy on Build** option in the **Set Up** card. Note that this feature requires **Auto Build on Commit** to be enabled.

3. **Environment-Specific Configurations**: If your component requires specific configurations for the target environment, make sure to set those in the **Deploy** page under the relevant environment card before triggering the deployment.

4. **Promote to Higher Environments**: If you want to promote the component to a higher environment (e.g., from development to production), you must request an approval if the environment is critical. This involves:
   - Clicking on your component in the **Component Listing** pane.
   - Going to the **Deploy** section and selecting the **Development** card to request a promotion.

5. **Redeploying if Necessary**: If you need to reapply configurations or restart the running instances of your component, you can do so by clicking on **Redeploy Release** on the **Runtime** page.

Once the deployment is complete, the component will be running in the specified environment, and you can manage it further from the Choreo Console.

For more detailed information, you can check the following sections in the documentation:
- [Components and environments](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/resource-hierarchy/#components-and-environments)
- [Request approval for environment promotion](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/submit-and-manage-workflow-approval-requests/#request-approval-for-environment-promotion)
- [Redeploy a release](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/view-runtime-details/#redeploy-a-release)
- [Deployment](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/ci-cd/#deployment)","To deploy a component to an environment in Choreo, follow these steps:

1. **Log in to Choreo**: Access the Choreo platform using your credentials.

2. **Navigate to the Environment**: Go to the environment where you want to deploy the component. You can find this under the ""Environments"" section or by clicking on the specific environment name.

3. **Select the Component**: Choose the component you wish to deploy from the list of available components or by searching for it.

4. **Configure the Component**: Set any necessary configurations for the component, such as parameters, settings, or connections to other services.

5. **Deploy the Component**: Click on the ""Deploy"" or ""Deploy to Environment"" button to deploy the component to the selected environment.

6. **Verify Deployment**: Check the deployment status and logs to ensure that the component has been successfully deployed and is functioning correctly.

7. **Test the Component**: Once deployed, test the component to make sure it works as expected within the environment.

"After deploying a component, can I promote its image to other environments?","Yes, once your component's container image is deployed to an environment, you can easily promote that same container image across other environments available within the same project.","Yes, a deployed component's image can be promoted to other environments in Choreo. Here's how you can do it:

### Steps to Promote a Deployed Component's Image

1. **Component Creation and Deployment**:
   - Ensure that you have a component created, built, and initially deployed to the development environment.

2. **Approval Workflow**:
   - Make sure an approval workflow is configured for environment promotion, especially if you are promoting the component to critical environments like production.

3. **Requesting Promotion**:
   - In the Choreo Console, navigate to the **Component Listing** pane and select the component you want to promote. This will take you to the **Overview** page of that component.
   - Click on the **Deploy** option in the left navigation menu.
   - Locate the **Development** card and click on **Request to Promote**.
   - A **Request Approval** pane will open where you can enter the request details. After filling it out, click **Submit**. This will notify all authorized personnel about the request for promotion.

4. **Approval Process**:
   - Once the request is submitted, it will be pending review. During this time, other developers are restricted from making the same request until the current request is either approved or rejected.
   - When an authorized assignee approves your request, you will receive a confirmation email, allowing you to proceed with promoting the component to the intended environment.

5. **Environment Specifications**:
   - When promoting, you can also override configuration values with environment-specific values.

### Additional Information
- Choreo provides multiple environments (e.g., development and production) for projects, and components can be promoted across these environments.
- The initial deployment typically happens in the first environment, and subsequent promotions can be performed to higher environments.
