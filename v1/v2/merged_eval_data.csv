I've just deployed a new `UserAuthentication` service component with an endpoint to its initial environment in Choreo. Do I need to perform any manual steps to make it discoverable in the Choreo Marketplace?,"No, you do not need to manually add it. Upon deployment to the initial environment, Choreo services are automatically added to the Marketplace. Choreo effortlessly collects essential details like the component name, endpoint name, description, and service definitions during this deployment to generate the corresponding service entry.","To make a newly deployed service discoverable in the Choreo Marketplace, you need to follow these key steps:

1. **Create and Deploy the Service**: 
   - Start by creating a service component in Choreo. You can do this by selecting **Service** under **Create a Component** on the project home page.
   - Connect Choreo to your GitHub account and choose the appropriate GitHub repository for your service.
   - Provide the necessary details such as the component display name and description.
   - Once the service is created, you will need to build and deploy the service. During the deployment process, ensure that the **Network Visibility** is set to **Public** to expose the service for consumption.

2. **Automatic Addition to the Marketplace**:
   - Upon deployment to the initial environment, the service will be automatically added to the Choreo Marketplace. Choreo collects essential details such as the component name, endpoint name, description, and service definitions during this deployment. 
   - The service will be identifiable by an endpoint within the Choreo service component, and it will be showcased in the Marketplace with a name following the convention of `component name - endpoint name`.

3. **Discoverability**:
   - Once your service is deployed, you can use the Marketplace's search and filter capabilities to make it easily discoverable. Users can search by service name or apply filters based on service type and network visibility.

Following these steps ensures that your service is not only deployed but also visible and discoverable in the Choreo Marketplace.

For detailed instructions, you can refer to the following documents:

"I see `v1` and `v2` entries for a `ProductCatalog` service in the Choreo Marketplace. If the actual deployed versions are `v1.0`, `v1.1`, `v1.2`, and `v2.0`, which specific versions do the `v1` and `v2` entries in the Marketplace represent?","In the Choreo Marketplace, service versions are displayed in their major version format, representing the *latest* version of the service within that major version. Therefore, the `v1` entry would represent `v1.2` (the latest within the `v1` major version), and the `v2` entry would represent `v2.0` (the latest within the `v2` major version).","
In the Choreo Marketplace, versioning is represented in a structured manner to provide clarity on the different versions of APIs available. The versioning convention typically follows a format where entries like `v1` and `v2` map to actual deployed versions such as `v1.0`, `v1.1`, `v1.2`, and `v2.0`.

For example, if an API is labeled as `v1`, it signifies the first major version of the API. Subsequent updates or revisions within this major version are represented by appending a minor version number after the major version, such as `v1.0`, `v1.1`, `v1.2`, and so on. These minor versions usually indicate incremental changes, bug fixes, or enhancements within the same major version.

Similarly, a new major version like `v2` would introduce significant changes or updates that may not be backward compatible with the previous major version. Subsequent revisions within this new major version would follow the same pattern of appending minor version numbers like `v2.0`, `v2.1`, `v2.2`, and so forth.

This versioning structure helps users in the Choreo Marketplace to easily identify and differentiate between different versions of APIs, understand the scope of changes introduced in each version, and make informed decisions based on their specific requirements or compatibility needs.

If you need more detailed information on a specific API version or its deployment status, feel free to ask for assistance!","The `v1` and `v2` entries in the Choreo Marketplace likely represent the latest minor versions of each major version available. 

Given the actual deployed versions are `v1.0`, `v1.1`, `v1.2`, and `v2.0`, the `v1` entry in the Marketplace would represent `v1.2` (assuming it is the most recent minor version of `v1`), and the `v2` entry would represent `v2.0`.

   - After enabling auto build, go to the **Deploy** page and enable **Auto Deploy on Build**. This will automatically trigger deployment once the build is completed.

### Important Notes

- The first build for a Ballerina component must be triggered manually to apply the required configurations.
- Subsequent changes in configurations will result in a new deployment.
- Ensure that all configurable values in your source code are correctly defined to avoid failures during the auto-build process.

For further details, you can refer to the [Choreo documentation on developing a Ballerina service](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/develop-services/develop-a-ballerina-service/#step-2-build-and-deploy) and [CI/CD practices](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/ci-cd/#deployment).","To deploy your first Ballerina microservice to Choreo, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Register for an Account**: If you haven't already, sign up for a Choreo account.

2. **Create a New Service**: Log into Choreo and create a new service for your Ballerina microservice.

3. **Upload Your Microservice**: Use the Choreo CLI or the web interface to upload your Ballerina microservice code. You can use the `ballerina build` command to compile your Ballerina code into a JAR file, which can then be uploaded to Choreo.

4. **Configure Environment Variables**: Set up any necessary environment variables in the Choreo dashboard that your microservice might require.

5. **Deploy to Development Environment**: Deploy your microservice to the development environment in Choreo. This typically involves selecting the appropriate environment (development, staging, production) and clicking a deploy button.

6. **Test Your Deployment**: Once deployed, test your microservice to ensure it's running correctly in the development environment.

For automating subsequent builds, you can set up a CI/CD pipeline using tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI. Here’s a simple example using GitHub Actions:

```yaml
name: Build and Deploy Ballerina Microservice

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout Repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Java
      uses: actions/setup-java@v2
      with:
        distribution: 'adopt'
        java-version: '17'

    - name: Build Ballerina Microservice
      run: ballerina build src/main.bal

    - name: Upload JAR to Choreo
      env:
        CHOREO_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.CHOREO_API_KEY }}
      run: |
        curl -X POST \
          -H ""Authorization: Bearer $CHOREO_API_KEY"" \
          -F ""file=@target/my-microservice.jar"" \
          https://api.choreo.io/v1/services/{service-id}/deployments
```

This YAML configuration sets up a GitHub Action that automatically builds your Ballerina microservice whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch or a pull request is created. It then uploads the resulting JAR file to the specified Choreo service.

Remember to replace `{service-id}` with the actual ID of your service in Choreo and ensure that the `CHOREO_API_KEY` is securely stored as a secret in your GitHub repository settings.","You are a helpful assistant made to answer questions about the Choreo documentation.

My Java Spring Boot application needs different database connection strings for development and production environments. How do I manage these environment-specific configurations in Choreo?,"To manage environment-specific configurations for your Java Spring Boot application, navigate to the 'Deploy' page of your component in Choreo. From there, locate the card corresponding to the specific environment (e.g., 'Development' or 'Production'), make your necessary configuration changes (like updating database connection strings), and then trigger a new deployment for that environment. These configurations are injected at runtime and are kept separate from your source code.","To manage environment-specific configurations, such as database connection strings, for a Java Spring Boot application in Choreo, you can follow these steps:

### 1. Define Environment-Specific Configurations
Choreo allows you to create environment-specific configurations that apply to a particular environment. Here’s how to change them:

- Navigate to the **Deploy** page of your component.
- Locate the specific environment card you want to modify.
- Make the necessary configuration changes for that environment.
- Trigger a new deployment to apply these changes.

### 2. Use Environment Variables
You can also manage configurations using environment variables:

- In the **Choreo Console**, go to the **Component Listing** pane and select your component.
- Click on **DevOps** in the left navigation menu, then select **Configs & Secrets**.
- Click on **+ Create** and then choose **Environment Variables**.
- Optionally, mark the variables as secrets if needed.
- Specify a display name for easy identification and add your environment variables as key-value pairs.
- Click **Create** to save these environment variables.

### 3. Create Configuration Groups (Optional)
For better management of reusable configurations across multiple components, consider creating Configuration Groups:

- In the **DevOps** section, click on **Configuration Groups** and then on **Create**.
- Define the keys and assign values for different environments.
- Once created, you can link this configuration group to your component during deployment.

### Important Notes
- All configurations and secrets are encrypted and stored securely.
- Environment-specific configurations allow you to maintain different values (like database connection strings) for different environments (e.g., development, production) without hardcoding them into your application.

For more detailed information on managing these configurations, you can refer to the relevant documentation here: 
- [Configuration Management](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/configuration-management/)
- [Manage Configurations and Secrets](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/manage-configurations-and-secrets/#apply-environment-variables-to-your-container)
- [Manage Configuration Groups](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/manage-configuration-groups/)","In Choreo, you can manage environment-specific configurations like database connection strings using profile-specific properties files or environment variables. Here’s how you can set this up:

### Using Profile-Specific Properties Files

1. **Create Profile-Specific Property Files:**
   - Create separate property files for each environment (e.g., `application-dev.properties` for development and `application-prod.properties` for production).
   - Place these files in the `src/main/resources` directory of your Spring Boot project.

2. **Configure Profiles in Application Properties:**
   - In your main `application.properties` file, specify which profiles are active:
     ```properties
     spring.profiles.active=dev
     ```
   - For production, you would set:
     ```properties
     spring.profiles.active=prod
     ```

3. **Use Properties in Your Code:**
   - Access the properties in your Java code using `@Value` or `@ConfigurationProperties`.

### Using Environment Variables

1. **Set Environment Variables:**
   - Set environment variables for each environment (e.g., `DATABASE_URL` for the database URL).

2. **Read Environment Variables in Application Properties:**
   - Use placeholders in your `application.properties` file:
     ```properties
     spring.datasource.url=${DATABASE_URL}
     ```

3. **Override in Profiles:**
   - You can also override these values in profile-specific property files if needed.

### Example Configuration

#### `application-dev.properties`
```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/dev_db
```

#### `application-prod.properties`
```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://prod_host:3306/prod_db
```

#### Using Environment Variables
- Set `DATABASE_URL` in your development environment to `jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/dev_db`.
- Set `DATABASE_URL` in your production environment to `jdbc:mysql://prod_host:3306/prod_db`.

By following these steps, you can easily manage different database connection strings for development and production environments in your Choreo-based Java Spring Boot application.","You are a helpful assistant made to answer questions about the Choreo documentation.

"I want to set up a fully automated CI/CD pipeline for my Node.js API in Choreo so that every time I push a commit, it builds and deploys automatically. How do I achieve this?","To set up a fully automated CI/CD pipeline for your Node.js API, you need to enable two features in Choreo. First, on the 'Build' page, enable 'Auto Build on Commit'. This will automatically trigger a build for every new commit. Second, on the 'Deploy' page, go to the 'Set Up' card and enable 'Auto Deploy on Build'. This will automatically initiate deployment once an automatic build completes. Note that 'Auto Deploy on Build' requires 'Auto Build on Commit' to be enabled.","To set up a fully automated CI/CD pipeline for your Node.js API in Choreo, follow these steps:

### 1. Create a Service Component
First, create a service component for your Node.js API:
- In the Choreo Console, navigate to your project and click **+ Create**.
- Select the **Service** card.
- Enter a display name, a unique name, and a description for your service component.
- Connect your GitHub repository by clicking on the **GitHub** tab and authorizing Choreo to access your repository. This is necessary for enabling auto-deployment.
- Specify the buildpack as **NodeJS** and provide the appropriate project directory for your Node.js application.
- Click **Create** to finalize the service component.

For detailed steps on creating a service component, refer to the documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/develop-services/expose-a-websocket-endpoint-via-a-nodejs-service/#step-1-create-a-service-component).

### 2. Enable Auto Build on Commit
To ensure that builds are automatically triggered with each commit:
- Navigate to the **Build** page of your service component.
- Enable **Auto Build on Commit**. This option ensures that any commit pushed to the connected GitHub repository will trigger a build automatically.

### 3. Enable Auto Deploy on Build
Once you have auto-build enabled, you should also enable automatic deployments:
- Go to the **Deploy** page of your service component.
- Find the option for **Auto Deploy on Build** and enable it. This will automatically deploy your service after a successful build.

### 4. Monitor Builds and Deployments
You can monitor the build and deployment processes:
- On the **Build** page, you can view logs for each build, which will help you troubleshoot any issues that arise during the build process.
- The **Deploy** page allows you to see the status of your deployments and any configurations that were applied.

### 5. Promote to Higher Environments
If you have multiple environments set up (like development and production), you can promote your service to higher environments manually after testing in lower environments. This follows the *build once, deploy many* strategy.

By following these steps, you will have a fully automated CI/CD pipeline for your Node.js API in Choreo, ensuring that your application is built and deployed automatically with every commit.

For further details, you can refer to the relevant documentation:
- CI/CD Overview: [CI/CD Documentation](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/ci-cd/)
- Manage Continuous Deployment Pipelines: [CD Pipelines Documentation](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/manage-continuous-deployment-pipelines/#add-a-continuous-deployment-pipeline-to-a-project)","To set up a fully automated CI/CD pipeline for your Node.js API in Choreo, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create an Environment**:
   - Go to Choreo and create a new environment for your Node.js API.
   - Ensure the environment is configured with the necessary dependencies and runtime settings.

3. **Configure Choreo to Trigger Builds on Code Changes**:
   - In Choreo, go to the environment settings where your Node.js API is hosted.
   - Enable the ""Continuous Integration"" feature if available. This typically involves setting up a webhook or triggering builds on push events from your Git repository.

4. **Define Deployment Steps**:
   - In the Choreo environment, define the deployment steps. This usually includes building your application, running tests (if any), and deploying the application to the desired environment (e.g., staging, production).
   - You might need to use Choreo's scripting capabilities or integrate with external tools like Docker for containerization.

5. **Automate Testing**:
   - If your project has unit tests, configure Choreo to run them as part of the build process.
   - Ensure that the tests pass before the deployment proceeds.

6. **Set Up Notifications**:
   - Configure notifications in Choreo to get alerts about build status, deployment success/failure, etc.

7. **Test Your Pipeline**:
   - Push a small change to your Git repository to trigger a build and deployment in Choreo.
   - Verify that the pipeline works as expected and that the application is deployed correctly.

8. **Monitor and Maintain**:
   - Regularly monitor the performance and health of your CI/CD pipeline.
   - Update the pipeline configuration as needed to handle changes in your application or infrastructure.

I have an external API key for my Python Flask application that I need to inject at runtime. How can I securely store and inject this secret into my Choreo-deployed service?,"Choreo allows you to inject configurations and secrets, such as external API keys, at the environment level during runtime. These are stored in a secure vault, encrypted at rest and in transit. To manage these, you would define them as environment-specific configurations. Go to the 'Deploy' page, select the specific environment card, and add your API key there. Choreo will then inject this secret into your Python Flask application at runtime, ensuring strict separation from your source code.","To securely store and inject secrets like API keys in a Choreo-deployed service, you can manage your configurations and secrets through Choreo's built-in features. Here’s how to do it:

### Managing Configurations and Secrets

1. **Environment Configuration**: Choreo allows you to manage and version your component's configurations and secrets as either file mounts or environment variables. This means you can set different configurations for different environments (e.g., development, production).

2. **Secure Storage**: All configurations and secrets applied to a Choreo component are stored in an encrypted secret vault in the cloud data plane managed by WSO2. If you are using a private data plane, the secrets can be stored in an Azure Key Vault or AWS Secret Manager attached to your data plane.

3. **Adding Secrets**:
   - In the Choreo Console, select your component.
   - Navigate to the **Deploy** section.
   - Click on **Configure and Deploy**.
   - Select **Add Environment Configurations** and specify the secret values.
     - **Name**: Provide an appropriate name for the secret/alias.
     - **Value**: Enter the value for the secret.
   - Make sure to select **Mark as a Secret** to ensure it is treated securely.
   - After adding the secret, you can deploy your component.

4. **Accessing Secrets in Code**: Once the secret has been created, you can access it in your integration code using a specific syntax. For example:
   ```xml
   <property name=""secret_value_1"" expression=""wso2:vault-lookup('your_secret_name')"" scope=""default"" type=""STRING""/>
   ```
   This retrieves the secret from the vault and allows you to use it within your application securely.

### Additional Security with API Keys

If your service requires API keys, you can generate and manage API keys through the Choreo Developer Portal. Here's how:

1. **Creating an API Key**: First, you need to create an application in the Choreo Developer Portal, which represents the entity consuming the API.
2. **Generating the Key**: Navigate to the API section, select the API, and generate an API key for your application. You can configure environment-specific API keys for production or sandbox environments.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your sensitive information, like API keys, is stored securely and injected appropriately into your Choreo-deployed services.

For more detailed information, you can refer to the following documentation:
- [Manage Configurations and Secrets](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/manage-configurations-and-secrets/)
- [Working with sensitive data using MI Secure Vault](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/work-with-the-micro-integrator-runtime-in-choreo/#working-with-sensitive-data-using-mi-secure-vault)","To securely store and inject an external API key into your Choreo-deployed Python Flask application at runtime, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Secret in Choreo:**
   - Log in to your Choreo account.
   - Navigate to the Secrets Management section.
   - Create a new secret with the name `API_KEY` and set its value to your external API key.

2. **Configure Your Service to Use the Secret:**
   - In your Choreo service configuration, ensure that the environment where your Flask application runs has access to the secrets.
   - Use Choreo's environment variables to reference the secret. For example, you can set an environment variable named `API_KEY` to reference the secret.

3. **Access the Secret in Your Flask Application:**
   - In your Flask application code, retrieve the API key from the environment variable. Here’s a simple example:

```python
from os import environ

app = Flask(__name__)

api_key = environ.get('API_KEY')

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return f""Your API Key is: {api_key}""

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

By following these steps, you can securely store and inject your external API key into your Choreo-deployed service without exposing sensitive information.","You are a helpful assistant made to answer questions about the Choreo documentation.

How does Choreo ensure my users don't experience downtime when I deploy a new version of my React frontend's backend API?,"Choreo ensures zero downtime during deployments and promotions by performing rolling updates. When a new build of your React frontend's backend API is deployed, Choreo conducts a health check on the new version. Only after the new build passes its health checks is traffic switched to it from the currently running version, preventing any service interruption for your users.","Choreo ensures zero downtime during deployments through a mechanism called **rolling updates**. Here’s how it works:

1. **Rolling Updates**: This strategy allows Choreo to update components gradually rather than all at once, ensuring that some instances of the current version remain available while the new version is being deployed.

2. **Health Checks**: Before any traffic is directed to the new build, it undergoes a health check. This step is crucial as it verifies that the new version is functioning correctly. If the health checks are not configured properly, there’s a risk of deploying and promoting an unhealthy version of the component.

3. **Traffic Management**: Once the new build passes the health check, traffic is switched from the current build to the new build, maintaining service availability throughout the process.

By following this approach, Choreo minimizes disruption and maintains service reliability even when deploying new versions of APIs.

For more detailed information, you can refer to the following documentation: [Zero-downtime deployments](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/ci-cd/#zero-downtime-deployments).","Choreo ensures that your users don't experience downtime during the deployment of a new version of your React frontend's backend API through a process called zero-downtime deployment or blue-green deployment.

Here’s how it works:

1. **Create a New Environment**: Before deploying the new version, create a new environment (often referred to as ""green"") alongside the existing one (often referred to as ""blue"").

2. **Deploy the New Version**: Deploy the new version of your backend API to the new environment.

3. **Test the New Version**: Ensure the new version is working correctly in the new environment before switching traffic.

4. **Switch Traffic**: Once the new version is verified to be working properly, switch the traffic from the old environment (blue) to the new environment (green).

5. **Remove Old Environment**: After confirming everything is working fine with the new version, you can safely remove the old environment (blue).

This approach ensures that users are never directly impacted by the deployment because they are always served from an environment that is known to be working correctly.","You are a helpful assistant made to answer questions about the Choreo documentation.

"Can I integrate my unit tests for my Java application directly into Choreo's build pipeline, and if so, how?","Yes, Choreo's buildpacks support integrating unit tests directly into the build pipeline for certain component types. While the document mentions referring to 'Integrate Unit Tests into the Build Pipeline' for more details, the general process involves configuring your build pipeline to execute your unit tests as part of the build process before the container image is pushed to the registry.","To integrate unit tests for a Java application into Choreo's build pipeline, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Write Tests
- Create unit tests within your source code using standard testing libraries. For detailed guidance on creating unit tests, you can refer to the [Creating a Unit Test Suite](https://mi.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/develop/creating-unit-test-suite/) documentation.

### Step 2: Enable Unit Tests
1. In the **Component Listing** pane of the Choreo Console, select the component for which you want to enable unit tests.
2. Navigate to the left menu and click on **Build**.
3. On the **Build** page, edit the **Build Configurations**.
4. Turn on the **Unit Test** toggle.
5. Click **Save**.

### Step 3: Trigger a New Build
- To initiate a new build with the unit tests enabled, click **Build Latest** on the **Build** page. You can monitor the build's progress in the **Build Details** pane.

### Important Note
Choreo currently supports unit tests only for the `WSO2 MI` buildpack, so ensure your application is compatible.

For more details, you can check the documentation on [Integrate Unit Tests into the Build Pipeline](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/integrate-unit-tests-into-the-build-pipeline/).","Integrating your unit tests for a Java application directly into Choreo's build pipeline is possible, but it depends on how Choreo is configured and what tools you are using. Generally, you can achieve this by setting up a CI/CD pipeline that runs your unit tests as part of the build process.

Here’s a high-level approach:

1. **Set Up Your Build Script**: Use a build tool like Maven or Gradle to run your unit tests. For example, in a `pom.xml` file for Maven, you can include the following in your `build` section:
    ```xml
    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>3.0.0-M5</version>
                <configuration>
                    <skipTests>false</skipTests>
                </configuration>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>
    ```
   This configuration ensures that the unit tests are executed during the build process.

2. **Configure Your Choreo Pipeline**: In Choreo, you need to set up a pipeline that includes a step to run your build script. Here’s an example of how you might configure this in Choreo:

    - **Source Code Repository**: Connect Choreo to your source code repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
    - **Build Step**: Create a step in Choreo to run your build script. You can use a command-line step to execute your build command, such as:
        ```sh
        mvn clean install
        ```
    - **Test Step**: After the build step, add another step to run your unit tests. You can use a command-line step again, specifying the test goal, e.g.:
        ```sh
        mvn test
        ```

3. **Monitor and Trigger**: Ensure that your pipeline is set to automatically trigger builds when changes are pushed to the repository. You can also manually trigger builds if needed.

4. **Integrate with Other Steps**: Depending on your needs, you can integrate this with other steps in your pipeline, such as deploying to a staging environment after successful tests.

By following these steps, you can integrate your unit tests into Choreo’s build pipeline, ensuring that they run automatically as part of your continuous integration process.","You are a helpful assistant made to answer questions about the Choreo documentation.

"I've deployed my Node.js API as a service component in Choreo. If I experience a sudden surge in user traffic, how can I scale this specific API independently to handle the load?","Since each component in Choreo maps to a single pod in the Kubernetes cluster at deployment time, you can deploy, manage, and scale each component independently. This means you can scale your Node.js API component up or down without affecting other components in your project.","To scale a specific API independently in Choreo to handle increased user traffic, you can utilize the ""scale-to-zero"" feature. This functionality allows your API to automatically adjust its resources based on incoming traffic. Here’s how it works:

### How Scale to Zero Works
1. **Automatic Scaling**: When your API receives an HTTP request, Choreo scales up from zero to handle the request. If your API remains idle for a period (default is approximately 5 minutes), it will scale back down to zero.
2. **Dynamic Adjustments**: If there is a surge in traffic, Choreo will automatically increase the number of replicas up to a defined maximum limit. This is based on the number of pending requests; if the queued requests exceed a certain threshold (default is 100), Choreo will spawn additional replicas to manage the load.

### Steps to Enable Scale to Zero
To enable the scale-to-zero feature for your API:

1. In the **Component Listing** pane, click on your API component.
2. Ensure that the component is deployed and ready to receive traffic.
3. Navigate to **DevOps** in the left menu, then click on **Scaling**.
4. For both free and paid users, you will see a **scale-to-zero** card. Click on it to enable the feature. 

### Notes
- The initial request after a period of inactivity might experience a delay as it requires scaling up from zero.
- You can set the maximum number of replicas for your deployment to ensure it can handle high traffic demands.

For more detailed information, you can refer to the documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/autoscale/autoscale-components-with-scale-to-zero/#how-scale-to-zero-works-in-choreo).

This setup will help your API scale efficiently and handle increased user traffic effectively.","To scale your Node.js API independently in Choreo when you experience a surge in user traffic, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Service**: Make sure you have identified the specific service component in Choreo that hosts your Node.js API.

2. **Check Scaling Options**: Look for the scaling options available in Choreo. Typically, you should see an option to set a minimum and maximum number of instances or use auto-scaling based on CPU usage, memory, or custom metrics.

3. **Configure Auto-Scaling**:
   - Go to the settings or configuration section of your service component.
   - Set up auto-scaling rules based on the metric that best represents your application's load (e.g., CPU utilization, request rate).
   - Define the thresholds for scaling up and down. For example, if your CPU usage exceeds 70%, automatically increase the number of instances, and decrease them when usage drops below 30%.

4. **Manual Scaling**: If you prefer manual control, you can manually adjust the number of instances to handle the load. Increase the number of instances temporarily during peak times and reduce them when traffic decreases.

5. **Monitor Performance**: Use Choreo’s monitoring tools to keep an eye on the performance and scaling behavior of your API. This helps you fine-tune your scaling settings for optimal performance.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your Node.js API scales appropriately to handle sudden surges in traffic without impacting the overall performance of your application.","You are a helpful assistant made to answer questions about the Choreo documentation.

Which Choreo component type should I choose for this, and how do I configure it to run every day at a specific time?","For a daily data synchronization job, you should use a 'scheduled integration' component type. This type is designed for jobs/tasks and allows you to configure a cron expression to schedule its execution at specific times, such as daily.","To set up a daily data synchronization job using a Java application in Choreo, you should use a **Scheduled Task** component. This component allows you to automate the execution of tasks at specified intervals, making it ideal for your requirement of running a job every day.

### Configuration Steps for a Scheduled Task:
1. **Create the Scheduled Task Component**: In the Choreo console, you can create a new component type and select ""Scheduled Task"" as the type.
  
2. **Define the Job Logic**: Write the Java code that will handle the data synchronization logic. This code will be executed at the defined schedule.

3. **Set the Schedule**: You can configure the scheduling of your task using a cron expression. For instance, to run your job every day at a specific time (e.g., 2 AM), you can use the following cron expression:
   ```
   0 2 * * *
   ```
   This expression means the job will trigger at 2 AM every day.

4. **Deploy the Scheduled Task**: After developing your scheduled task and configuring the schedule, you can deploy it using the Choreo console.

5. **Monitoring and Observations**: Once deployed, you can test and monitor the scheduled task through the Choreo console to ensure it operates as expected.

Using a Scheduled Task in Choreo simplifies the automation of recurring tasks like data synchronization, allowing for more efficient processes with less manual oversight.

For more detailed instructions on developing a scheduled task, you can refer to the documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/develop-integrations/develop-a-scheduled-task/).","For setting up a daily data synchronization job using a Java application, you should use the ""Scheduled Job"" component type in Choreo.

Here’s how you can configure it to run every day at a specific time:

1. **Create a Scheduled Job:**
   - Go to the Choreo platform and navigate to the ""Components"" section.
   - Click on ""Add Component"" and select ""Scheduled Job"".

2. **Configure the Schedule:**
   - In the Scheduled Job settings, you can define when the job should run.
   - Set the schedule to run daily at the specific time you need. For example, if you want it to run every day at 3 AM, you would set the cron expression to `0 0 3 * * ?`.

3. **Integrate Your Java Application:**
   - Attach your Java application to the Scheduled Job component.
   - Ensure that your Java application is properly configured to perform the data synchronization task.

4. **Test the Job:**
   - Before going live, test the scheduled job to ensure it runs correctly and performs the intended data synchronization.

By following these steps, you can set up a reliable and automated daily data synchronization job using Choreo.","You are a helpful assistant made to answer questions about the Choreo documentation.

"I'm developing a React single-page application (SPA). What Choreo component type is most suitable for hosting this frontend application, and how does it differ from deploying a backend API?","For hosting a React single-page application, you would typically use a 'web application' component type. Choreo supports various component types like 'services' (for APIs), 'API proxies', and 'web applications', each with unique features tailored to their characteristics. A web application component would be optimized for serving static or client-side rendered content, whereas a service component is for exposing APIs.","To host a React single-page application (SPA) in Choreo, the recommended component type is the **Web Application** component. Choreo allows you to create a web application by connecting to a GitHub repository that contains your application's source code. Here’s a brief overview of how to do this:

### Hosting a React SPA in Choreo
1. **Create a Web Application Component**:
   - Connect a repository that includes your React application source code.
   - Choose the **React** buildpack during the setup.
   - Specify the build command (e.g., `npm run build`) and the build output directory (e.g., `build`).
   - Enter the Node.js version you want to use (e.g., Node version 18).

2. **Deployment**:
   - Once the component is created, Choreo will automatically generate a build pipeline for your SPA and deploy it.

3. **Configuration Management**:
   - For SPAs, you should manage runtime configurations carefully. Choreo does not support embedding environment variables directly into the application. Instead, you can create a `config.js` file that contains the necessary runtime configuration variables, such as API endpoints, and include it in your `index.html`.
   - Ensure that sensitive information is not included in this configuration, as it will be accessible in the browser.

### Differences Between Hosting an SPA and Deploying a Backend API
- **Server Interaction**: SPAs typically run entirely in the browser and interact with backend APIs for data. They require exposing certain configurations to the client-side, whereas backend APIs handle requests on the server-side without exposing sensitive information directly to clients.
  
- **Deployment Components**: While SPAs are deployed as web applications, backend APIs are deployed as service components in Choreo. Service components are designed to manage API requests and provide responses, often not directly exposing their configurations like SPAs do.

For more detailed information, you can check the following documentation:
- [Build and Deploy a Single-Page Web Application](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/develop-web-applications/build-and-deploy-a-single-page-web-application/)","For hosting a React Single-Page Application (SPA) in Choreo, the most suitable component type would be the **Web App** component.

### How it differs from deploying a backend API:

1. **Purpose**:
   - **Web App**: Designed to serve static files like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript directly to clients. It's ideal for frontends that don't require server-side processing or database interactions.
   - **Backend API**: Typically used for server-side logic, handling requests, and interacting with databases. It returns data or responses to client-side applications logic.

2. **Interaction with Client**:
   - **Web App**: Directly serves the frontend code to the browser. The client (browser) handles rendering and interaction with the UI.
   - **Backend API**: Exposes endpoints that the frontend can call to fetch data or perform actions. The client (usually the frontend) makes HTTP requests to these endpoints.

3. **Deployment Considerations**:
   - **Web App**: Focuses on serving static content efficiently. You might need to configure caching and other performance optimizations.
   - **Backend API**: Requires more setup for routing, authentication, and database connections. You might also need to handle state management and complex business logic.

4. **Security**:
   - **Web App**: Generally less concerned with security since it doesn’t handle sensitive operations. Focuses on delivering a secure and fast-loading frontend.
   - **Backend API**: More critical for security due to handling sensitive data and operations. Requires proper authentication, authorization, and validation.

5. **Development Workflow**:
   - **Web App**: Primarily involves building and optimizing the frontend code. Deployment focuses on serving the built assets.
   - **Backend API**: Involves writing server-side logic, setting up routes, and managing database interactions. Deployment often includes setting up environments and scaling.

In summary, if you're developing a React SPA, the Web App component in Choreo is the right choice as it focuses on serving the frontend code directly to the client. For any backend functionality or API-related tasks, you would use a different component type designed for server-side operations.","You are a helpful assistant made to answer questions about the Choreo documentation.

The documentation states that each Choreo component maps to a single Kubernetes pod. What are the practical implications of this for my deployed Python microservice regarding resource allocation and isolation?,"The mapping of each Choreo component to a single Kubernetes pod means that your Python microservice will run within its own isolated environment. This provides dedicated resource allocation for your component and allows for independent deployment, management, and scaling, ensuring that actions on one component do not directly impact others.","When deploying a Python microservice as a Choreo component, it is essential to understand that each component maps to a single Kubernetes pod. This mapping has significant implications for resource allocation and isolation.

### Resource Allocation
1. **Resource Limits**: Each Choreo component has imposed resource usage limits to ensure that it does not consume more resources than necessary. This is critical in a shared environment like Kubernetes, where multiple components may run concurrently. 
   - If the microservice exceeds its allocated memory limit, the Kubernetes system will forcefully shut down and restart the container. This helps maintain overall system stability by preventing a single component from monopolizing resources.
   - Similarly, exceeding the CPU limit results in throttling, which can lead to increased latency in processing requests. Therefore, it's crucial to configure these resource limits appropriately based on the expected load and performance requirements of your microservice.

2. **Single Main Container**: Each Choreo component is limited to a single main container, which means that all the processes relevant to the microservice must run within this container. This can simplify deployment but also means that resource allocation must be carefully considered to ensure that the microservice can operate effectively without interfering with other components.

### Isolation
1. **Component Independence**: Since each component corresponds to a separate pod, it can be deployed, managed, and scaled independently from other components. This isolation allows for better fault tolerance and easier management of microservices. If one microservice fails or needs scaling, it does not directly impact the performance of others.

2. **Security and Governance**: The isolation also aids in security and governance. Each component can have its own set of permissions and access controls, reducing the risk of unintended interactions between components. This cell-based architecture enhances security by ensuring that the access to sensitive information is controlled at the component level.

### Summary
In summary, mapping a Choreo component to a single Kubernetes pod for a deployed Python microservice allows for efficient resource allocation and strong isolation. By setting appropriate resource limits, you can ensure that your microservice performs well without disrupting other workloads. Moreover, the independence of components facilitates better management and enhances security.

For more details on configuring resources and understanding the component structure in Choreo, you can refer to the following documentation:
- [Configure Container Resources, Commands, and Arguments](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/configure-container-resources-commands-and-arguments/)
- [Choreo Component Overview](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/component/)","Each Choreo component mapping to a single Kubernetes pod has several practical implications for your deployed Python microservice:

1. **Resource Allocation**:
   - **CPU and Memory**: Each pod gets its own set of resources (CPU and memory). You can specify these limits and requests in the pod's configuration. This ensures that your microservice gets the exact resources it needs without any competition from other services.
   - **Scalability**: Since each service is in its own pod, you can scale up or down independently. If one microservice needs more resources, you can allocate them without affecting others.

2. **Isolation**:
   - **Security**: Pods provide a level of isolation between different services. If one service misbehaves, it won’t affect others as they run in separate pods.
   - **Fault Tolerance**: If a pod fails, only that specific service is affected, not the entire application. You can configure automatic restarts and scaling policies to ensure high availability.

2. **Networking**:
   - **Inter-service Communication**: Each pod has its own IP address, which simplifies networking within the cluster. You can use labels and selectors to route traffic to specific pods.
   - **Load Balancing**: Services can be created to expose a set of pods, allowing external traffic to be load-balanced across them.

By understanding these implications, you can better manage and optimize the resources for your Python microservice, ensuring efficient and reliable operation within your Kubernetes environment.","You are a helpful assistant made to answer questions about the Choreo documentation.

"How do I connect my Node.js microservice deployed on Choreo to an external PostgreSQL database hosted on AWS RDS, ensuring secure access to the connection string?","To connect your Node.js microservice to an external PostgreSQL database like one on AWS RDS, you would utilize Choreo's 'Connections' feature. First, you create a connection to your AWS RDS instance within Choreo. Choreo will then provide a Connection ID along with a set of connection parameters (e.g., host, port, username, password, database name). You must then configure your Choreo component (your Node.js microservice) to map these connection parameters to specific environment variable names (e.g., `DB_HOST`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`). At runtime, Choreo dynamically injects the actual values into these environment variables. In your Node.js application, you would then programmatically retrieve these values using `process.env.DB_HOST`, `process.env.DB_USER`, etc., to construct your database connection string and establish the connection. This method ensures that connection details are loosely coupled from your service implementation.","To securely connect your Node.js microservice deployed on Choreo to an external PostgreSQL database on AWS RDS, and to ensure secure access to the connection string, follow these guidelines:

1. **Network Configuration**:
   - Ensure that the requests coming from the Choreo data plane are allowed by adding the specific data plane IP ranges to your AWS RDS instance's allowlist. If your Choreo component is deployed in the US data plane, add the IP range `20.22.170.144/28`. If it's in the EU data plane, use `20.166.183.112/28`. This allows your Choreo service to communicate with your AWS RDS PostgreSQL database securely.

2. **Connection Creation**:
   - In the Choreo Console, navigate to the **Connections** section under **Dependencies**.
   - Click on **+Create** to open the Marketplace view where you can create a new connection.
   - Choose to create a connection to an external service and follow the prompted steps to input your database connection details.

3. **Secure Storage of Credentials**:
   - Use Choreo's environment configuration settings to manage your database credentials securely. When creating the connection, you will have the option to define different credentials for different environments. Secret values for higher environments will be hidden to enhance security, while the values for the lowest environment will be visible for local use.

4. **Use a Database Driver**:
   - Utilize a PostgreSQL driver or ORM that is compatible with Node.js to establish the connection to your AWS RDS database. Ensure that the connection string is constructed using the credentials securely stored in Choreo.

5. **Best Practices**:
   - Follow best practices for managing sensitive information. Avoid hardcoding the connection string in your source code. Instead, retrieve it securely from Choreo's environment variables or configuration settings during runtime.

By implementing these steps, you can securely connect your Node.js microservice to your PostgreSQL database on AWS RDS while ensuring the safe management of your credentials.

For more detailed instructions on creating connections and managing credentials, you can refer to the following documentation:

- [Create a Connection](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/sharing-and-reusing/create-a-connection/)
- [Security and Data Protection](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/references/faq/#security-and-data-protection)","To connect your Node.js microservice deployed on Choreo to an external PostgreSQL database hosted on AWS RDS while ensuring secure access to the connection string, follow these steps:

1. **Store the Connection String Securely:**
   - Use a secrets management in Choreo to store the connection string securely. This can be done using Choreo's Secrets Manager or by storing it as an environment variable in your service.

2. **Retrieve the Connection String in Your Node.js Application:**
   - In your Node.js application, retrieve the connection string from the secrets manager or environment variables. Here’s how you can do it:

```javascript
const { SecretsManager } = require('aws-sdk');

// Initialize the Secrets Manager client
const secretsManager = new SecretsManager({ region: 'your-region' });

async function getSecret() {
  const secretName = 'your-secret-name';
  try {
    const getSecretValueResponse = await secretsManager.getSecretValue({ SecretId: secretName }).promise();
    return getSecretValueResponse.SecretString;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Error retrieving secret: ${error}`);
    throw error;
  }
}

getSecret().then((secret) => {
  // Parse the JSON string returned by Secrets Manager
  const secretData = JSON.parse(secret);
  const connectionString = secretData.connection_string; // Adjust key name as needed

  // Use the connection string to initialize your PostgreSQL client
  const { Pool } = require('pg');
  const pool = new Pool({
    connectionString: connectionString,
  });

  // Your application logic here
}).catch((err) => {
  console.error(err);
});
```

3. **Ensure Secure Transmission:**
   - Ensure that any communication between Choreo and your RDS instance is over HTTPS. This can be achieved by configuring your load balancer or API Gateway to use HTTPS.

4. **Monitor and Audit Access:**
   - Regularly monitor and audit access to the secrets to ensure they remain secure. Use Choreo’s logging and monitoring features to track who accessed the secrets and when.

"My Python FastAPI backend needs to send SMS messages via Twilio, and I anticipate other Python or Java microservices within the same Choreo project might also need to use Twilio in the future. What's the best way to set up this Twilio integration for project-wide reuse?","For a third-party service like Twilio that you intend to share and reuse across multiple components within the same Choreo project, the recommended approach is to create a 'Project Connection'. Project Connections are designed to be used by any component within that particular project. After creating the Project Connection for Twilio, Choreo will provide a Connection ID and relevant parameters (e.g., Twilio Account SID, Auth Token). You will then configure each component (like your Python FastAPI service or future Java microservices) to map these connection parameters to environment variable names (e.g., `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`). Your Python FastAPI service can then read these environment variables using `os.environ.get('TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID')` to initialize the Twilio client. This setup allows all components to refer to the same Twilio connection using its ID, promoting reuse and consistency across your project.",,"To set up Twilio integration for your Python FastAPI backend and ensure it can be reused across other Python or Java microservices within the same Choreo project, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Twilio Account**: If you haven't already, sign up for a Twilio account and get your Account SID, Auth Token, and a Twilio phone number.

2. **Install Twilio Python Library**: Ensure that the Twilio library is installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install twilio
   ```

3. **Create a Twilio Utility Module**: Create a reusable module (e.g., `twilio_util.py`) that contains functions for sending SMS messages. This module can be imported by any service that needs to send an SMS.

4. **Define Functions in the Module**:
   ```python
   # twilio_util.py
   from twilio.rest import Client

   def send_sms(to_phone_number, message):
       account_sid = 'your_account_sid'
       auth_token = 'your_auth_token'
       client = Client(account_sid, auth_token)

       message = client.messages.create(
           body=message,
           from_='your_twilio_phone_number',
           to=to_phone_number
       )
       return message.sid
   ```

5. **Import and Use the Module in Your FastAPI Backend**:
   ```python
   # main.py
   from fastapi import FastAPI
   from twilio_util import send_sms

   app = FastAPI()

   @app.post(""/send-sms/"")
   async def send_sms_endpoint(phone_number: str, message: str):
       sid = send_sms(phone_number, message)
       return {""message"": f""SMS sent successfully. Message SID: {sid}""}
   ```

6. **Use the Same Module in Other Microservices**:
   - For Python services, simply import the `twilio_util` module as shown above.
   - For Java services, you might need to create a similar utility class and use the Twilio Java library (`twilio-java`).

7. **Document the Usage**: Make sure to document how to use the `twilio_util` module so that other developers can easily integrate Twilio into their services.

"I have two Java Spring Boot microservices, `OrderService` and `PaymentService`, deployed within the same Choreo project. `OrderService` needs to retrieve payment status from `PaymentService`. How should I establish this inter-service communication securely and efficiently within Choreo?","To enable `OrderService` to securely and efficiently consume `PaymentService` when both are deployed within the same Choreo project, you should create a 'Project Connection'. This type of connection is ideal for integrating services within the same project, allowing `OrderService` to connect to `PaymentService` as a Choreo service. Choreo will provide a Connection ID and necessary connection parameters for `PaymentService`. You will then map these parameters to environment variables within `OrderService`'s configuration. At runtime, `OrderService` can read these environment variables (e.g., using `System.getenv(""PAYMENT_SERVICE_URL"")`) to programmatically establish the connection. A significant benefit here is that if `PaymentService` uses the OAuth security scheme, creating a Project Connection means both services will share the same OAuth application (client ID and client secret), simplifying security configuration and ensuring consistent authentication for this shared service across the project.",,"To establish secure and efficient inter-service communication between `OrderService` and `PaymentService` within the same Choreo project, you can follow these steps:

1. **Use API Gateway**: Configure an API Gateway in Choreo that acts as a single entry point for both services. This helps manage requests and responses between services.

2. **Implement Authentication and Authorization**: Use Choreo's built-in security features to authenticate and authorize requests. You can use OAuth 2.0 or JWT tokens to secure the communication.

3. **Define REST APIs**: Define RESTful APIs for both services in Choreo. Ensure that the APIs are well-documented and follow best practices for RESTful design.

"I'm developing a Go microservice in Choreo that needs to connect to a very specific, on-premise legacy SOAP service. This legacy service is only relevant to this single Go microservice and won't be used by any other components in my Choreo project. What's the recommended connection type for this scenario?","For a scenario where a connection to a specific legacy SOAP service is exclusive to a single Go microservice and not intended for reuse by other components in your Choreo project, the recommended connection type is a 'Component Connection'. Component Connections are defined at the individual component level and are used solely by that component. You would create this connection for your Go microservice, and Choreo would provide a Connection ID and parameters (e.g., `LEGACY_SOAP_ENDPOINT`, `LEGACY_SOAP_API_KEY`). You'll map these parameters to environment variables within your Go microservice's configuration. Your Go application can then retrieve these values using `os.Getenv(""LEGACY_SOAP_ENDPOINT"")` to establish the programmatic connection to the legacy service.",,"For connecting your Go microservice to an on-premise legacy SOAP service in Choreo, the recommended connection type would be a **Direct Connection**. 

Here’s why:

1. **Direct Connection**: This allows you to directly call the legacy SOAP service from your Go microservice without minimal overhead. You can use a SOAP client library for Go (like `go-soap` or `gowsdl`) to make the calls.

2. **Steps to Set Up Direct Connection**:
   - Use a SOAP client library for Go to create a client that can communicate with the legacy service.
   - Define the WSDL (Web Services Description Language) file if available, or manually define the service endpoints, operations, and message formats.

"My C# .NET component in Choreo needs to consume two different internal Choreo services, both secured with OAuth. Is there a way to streamline the OAuth setup so I don't have to manage separate client IDs and secrets for each connection within this single component?","Yes, if your C# .NET component consumes multiple Choreo services, and you define these integrations as 'Component Connections' under the OAuth security scheme, you can streamline the OAuth setup. The documentation states that Component Connections created to consume multiple Choreo services under the OAuth security scheme can share the same OAuth application by sharing the same client ID and client secret between all such connections. This means you can configure your component's connections to reuse the same OAuth credentials, simplifying management and ensuring consistent authentication for all internal Choreo services consumed by that specific C# .NET component.",,"To streamline the OAuth setup for your C# .NET component in Choreo when consuming multiple internal Choreo services, you can use a common OAuth client configuration. Here’s how you can achieve this:

1. **Create a Centralized OAuth Client**: Set up a single OAuth client that handles authentication for all services. This client can store the shared credentials (client ID and secret) securely.

2. **Use Dependency Injection**: Inject the OAuth client into your components where needed. This allows you to reuse the same OAuth client across different parts of your application without.

3. **Configuration Management**: Use a configuration file or environment variables to manage the OAuth credentials. This way, you only need to update them in one place if they change.

4. **OAuth Middleware**: Implement middleware or a service layer that abstracts the OAuth flow. This middleware can handle the authentication process and provide tokens to your components as needed.

Here’s a simple example using dependency injection in C#:

{
    string GetAccessToken();
}

{
    private readonly string _clientId;
    private readonly string _clientSecret;

    public OAuthClient(string clientId, string clientSecret)
    {
        _clientId = clientId;
        _clientSecret = clientSecret;
    }

    public string GetAccessToken()
    {
        // Implement the logic to get the access token using the client ID and secret
        // This could involve making an HTTP request to the OAuth endpoint
        return ""example_token"";
    }
}

public class MyComponent
{
    private readonly IOAuthClient _oauthClient;

    public MyComponent(IOAuthClient oauthClient)
    {
        _oauthClient = oauthClient;
    }

    public void DoSomething()
    {
        var accessToken = _oauthClient.GetAccessToken();
        // Use the access token to call other services
    }
}
```

In your application startup, configure the `IOAuthClient` with the necessary credentials:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddHttpClient<IOAuthClient, OAuthClient>(client =>
    {
        client.BaseAddress = new Uri(""https://your-oauth-provider.com"");
        client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue(""Bearer"", ""example_token"");
    });

    services.AddSingleton<IOAuthClient>(provider => provider.GetRequiredService<IHttpClientFactory>().CreateClient());
}
```

By following these steps, you can avoid managing separate client IDs and secrets for each connection within your single component, thus streamlining the OAuth setup.","You are a helpful assistant made to answer questions about the Choreo documentation.

"Once I've configured a Choreo Connection and mapped its parameters to environment variables, how does my application code (e.g., a Java Spring Boot app or a Node.js service) actually retrieve these values at runtime to establish a connection?","At runtime, Choreo dynamically injects the values of the configured connection parameters into the environment variables you've mapped them to. Your application code can then simply read these environment variables using standard language-specific methods. For example:
*   **Java Spring Boot:** You would use `System.getenv(""YOUR_ENV_VAR_NAME"")` or leverage Spring's `@Value(""${YOUR_ENV_VAR_NAME}"")` annotation.
*   **Node.js:** You would access them via `process.env.YOUR_ENV_VAR_NAME`.
*   **Python:** You would use `os.environ.get('YOUR_ENV_VAR_NAME')`.
*   **Go:** You would use `os.Getenv(""YOUR_ENV_VAR_NAME"")`.
*   **C# .NET:** You would use `Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(""YOUR_ENV_VAR_NAME"")`.
This approach ensures that the connection parameter values and the service connection creation remain loosely coupled, providing developers with flexibility and ease of maintenance.","To enable Java Spring Boot and Node.js applications to access environment variables that have been mapped from Choreo Connection parameters, you can follow these steps:

### 1. Create a Connection in Choreo
When you create a connection to a service on Choreo, it provides you with a Connection ID and connection parameters. You can configure your service to use this Connection ID and map the connection parameters to specific environment variable names in your Choreo component.

### 2. Mapping Connection Parameters
In your `component.yaml` file, you can define the connection configurations as follows:

```yaml
dependencies:
  connectionReferences:
    - name: <CONNECTION_NAME>
      resourceRef: <RESOURCE_IDENTIFIER>
```

Upon deployment, Choreo will automatically create the necessary environment variables. The following are some of the predefined environment variable names:

| Configuration Key       | Choreo-Defined Environment Variable Name                       |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| ServiceURL              | CHOREO_<CONNECTION_NAME>_SERVICEURL                           |
| ConsumerKey             | CHOREO_<CONNECTION_NAME>_CONSUMERKEY                          |
| ConsumerSecret          | CHOREO_<CONNECTION_NAME>_CONSUMERSECRET                       |
| TokenURL                | CHOREO_<CONNECTION_NAME>_TOKENURL                             |
| ChoreoAPIKey            | CHOREO_<CONNECTION_NAME>_CHOREOAPIKEY                        |

If you prefer custom names, you can define them explicitly using:

```yaml
configuration:
  env:
    - name: <YOUR_CUSTOM_ENV_VARIABLE_NAME>
      valueFrom:
        connectionRef:
          name: <CONNECTION_NAME>
          key: <PARAMETER_KEY>
```

### 3. Accessing Environment Variables in Your Application
Once the environment variables are set up in Choreo, you can access them in your Java Spring Boot or Node.js application.

#### For Node.js:
You can access the environment variables using `process.env`. Here’s a sample code snippet:

```javascript
const serviceURL = process.env.CHOREO_<CONNECTION_NAME>_SERVICEURL;
const consumerKey = process.env.CHOREO_<CONNECTION_NAME>_CONSUMERKEY;
const consumerSecret = process.env.CHOREO_<CONNECTION_NAME>_CONSUMERSECRET;
```

#### For Java Spring Boot:
In a Spring Boot application, you can access the environment variables using `@Value` annotation or `System.getenv()`. Here’s an example using `@Value`:

```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class MyService {
    @Value(""${CHOREO_<CONNECTION_NAME>_SERVICEURL}"")
    private String serviceURL;

    @Value(""${CHOREO_<CONNECTION_NAME>_CONSUMERKEY}"")
    private String consumerKey;

    @Value(""${CHOREO_<CONNECTION_NAME>_CONSUMERSECRET}"")
    private String consumerSecret;
}
```

### 4. Runtime Injection
Choreo dynamically injects the values into these environment variables at runtime, ensuring that your code remains decoupled from the specific connection parameters. This separation allows for easier maintenance and flexibility when managing configurations.

For more detailed information on using connections in your service, you can refer to the [Choreo documentation on connections](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/connections/) and the [documentation on consuming a service through a connection](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/sharing-and-reusing/use-a-connection-in-your-service/#consume-a-service-through-a-connection).","To retrieve the values of the environment variables in your application code, you can use the following methods:

### For Java Spring Boot App:
1. **Using `@Value` Annotation:**
   ```java
   import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
   import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

   @Component
   public class MyComponent {
       @Value(""${choreo.connection.param1}"")
       private String param1;

       // Use param1 as needed
   }
   ```
2. **Using `application.properties`:**
   Add the environment variable value to `application.properties`:
   ```properties
   choreo.connection.param1=value1
   ```

### For Node.js Service:
1. **Using Environment Variables Directly:**
   ```javascript
   const param1 = process.env.choreo_connection_param1;
   console.log(param1);
   ```
2. **Using Configuration Management Library (e.g., dotenv):**
   - Install `dotenv`:
     ```bash
     npm install dotenv
     ```
   - Load environment variables from `.env` file:
     ```javascript
     require('dotenv').config();
     const param1 = process.env.choreo_connection_param1;
     console.log(param1);
     ```
   - Create a `.env` file with:
     ```
     choreo_connection_param1=value1
     ```

By using these methods, your application can dynamically retrieve the necessary values from the environment variables at runtime, allowing it to establish connections via the configured Choreo Connection.","You are a helpful assistant made to answer questions about the Choreo documentation.

"How do I decide if my organization needs a Choreo private data plane instead of a cloud data plane for deploying our applications, especially concerning data privacy and control?","You should consider a private data plane (PDP) if your organization requires dedicated infrastructure for running its user applications, ensuring an added layer of privacy and control. In contrast, a cloud data plane utilizes a multi-tenanted infrastructure model. The PDP ensures strict containment of user data within its boundaries, as all traffic related to the runtime of user applications is restricted to the Choreo data plane.","When deciding between a Choreo private data plane and a cloud data plane, organizations should consider several factors, particularly regarding data privacy and control:

### Key Factors to Consider

1. **Infrastructure Control**:
   - **Private Data Plane (PDP)**: Offers dedicated infrastructure for a single organization. This means organizations have complete control over their data environment, enhancing privacy and security.
   - **Cloud Data Plane (CDP)**: Utilizes a multi-tenanted infrastructure model, which, while secure, means that resources are shared among multiple users. This may raise concerns for organizations handling sensitive data.

2. **Data Privacy**:
   - **PDP**: Data is stored and processed within the organization's own infrastructure or a dedicated environment. This setup ensures compliance with stringent data privacy regulations, as organizations can manage data locality.
   - **CDP**: Data is stored in a shared environment, which may expose it to additional risks, making it more challenging to ensure compliance with laws like GDPR or CCPA.

3. **Compliance and Regulatory Standards**:
   - **PDP**: Supports compliance with various regulatory standards by allowing organizations to keep data within specific geographic locations and environments.
   - **CDP**: While it offers compliance features, shared resources might complicate adherence to specific regulations.

4. **Security Measures**:
   - **PDP**: Provides extensive security features, including end-to-end network traffic encryption, and is designed for high availability and production-grade security. Organizations can implement their own security protocols and frameworks.
   - **CDP**: Security is managed by the cloud provider, which may include robust measures, but organizations have less control over security configurations and practices.

5. **Management Models**:
   - **PDP**: Offers various management models, including fully managed solutions by WSO2 or self-managed options, allowing organizations to choose the level of involvement they wish to have in managing their data plane.
   - **CDP**: Typically operates under a standard management model determined by the provider, which may not align with specific organizational needs.

6. **Observability and Logging**:
   - **PDP**: Logs and observability data are retained within the data plane, enhancing security and simplifying access for compliance purposes.
   - **CDP**: May involve data routing through different layers, which can complicate visibility and control over data access and logs.

### Conclusion

Organizations must assess their specific needs regarding data control, privacy, and compliance requirements before choosing between a Choreo private data plane and a cloud data plane. The choice will significantly impact how data is managed, stored, and protected.

For more detailed information, you can refer to the following documentation:
- [Choreo Data Planes](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/data-planes/#private-data-planes)","To decide whether your organization needs a Choreo private data plane over a cloud data plane, consider the following factors:

1. **Data Privacy and Security**: If your applications handle sensitive or regulated data (e.g., healthcare, financial, or personal information), a private data plane can provide better control over where data is processed and stored. Private data planes often offer more granular security controls and compliance features.

2. **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensure that your data complies with local laws and regulations regarding data storage and processing. A private data plane might be necessary if you need to meet specific regional or industry-specific compliance requirements.

3. **Network Latency and Performance**: For applications that require low latency or high performance, a private data plane can reduce network latency by processing data closer to the source. This is particularly important for real-time applications or those with strict SLAs.

4. **Control Over Data Processing**: With a private data plane, you have more control over how data is processed and transformed within your application. This can be crucial for custom processing logic or when you want to avoid vendor lock-in.

5. **Cost Considerations**: Private data planes may come with higher costs compared to cloud-based options due to infrastructure ownership and maintenance. Evaluate these costs against the benefits in terms of security, performance, and compliance.

6. **Scalability and Flexibility**: Assess your current and future scalability needs. A private data plane might offer better long-term scalability and flexibility, especially as your application grows or changes.

7. **Vendor Lock-In**: Consider whether you want to be locked into a particular cloud provider's ecosystem. A private data plane allows you to maintain independence from cloud vendors.

By evaluating these factors, you can determine if a Choreo private data plane aligns better with your organization’s needs for data privacy, security, and control compared to a cloud data plane.","You are a helpful assistant made to answer questions about the Choreo documentation.

My organization has strict outbound network policies. Which specific endpoints and protocols do I need to whitelist for a Choreo private data plane to communicate effectively with the Choreo control plane and other external services?,"All communications from the private data plane are outbound, meaning you don't need to open specific `IP:Port` for inbound traffic. However, if your network restricts all outbound traffic, you must permit outbound traffic to the public IP range of the Choreo control plane. Key outbound connections include:

- **Choreo PDP agent:** To Choreo control plane (mizzen server) via WSS, and to Kubernetes API server (cluster internal) via HTTPS, WS.
- **APIM/local adaptor:** To Global adaptor via HTTPS, and to Azure Service Bus (CP) via AMQP.
- **APIM/Enforcer:** To Event hub (CP) via AMQP.

| Flux Helm controller      | Choreo container registry         | Outbound                      | HTTPS         |

### Additional Notes
- All communications between the control plane and the private data plane are encrypted using TLS.
- If your organization's network restricts all outbound traffic, you must allow outbound traffic to the public IP range of the Choreo control plane.

You can find more detailed information about setting up and managing these connections in the [Choreo documentation on Private Data Planes](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/data-planes/#private-data-planes).","To ensure effective communication between your Choreo private data plane and the Choreo control plane and other external services, you need to whitelist the following endpoints and protocols:

1. **Control Plane Communication:**
   - **Endpoints:** `api.choreo.io` (or any custom domain specified in your Choreo configuration)
   - **Protocols:** HTTPS

2. **External Service Communication:**
   - **Endpoints:** The URLs of the external services you intend to integrate with (e.g., third-party APIs, databases, etc.)
   - **Protocols:** Typically HTTPS, but this can vary depending on the service. Check the documentation for each external service.

3. **Internal Choreo Services:**
   - **Endpoints:** `internal.choreo.io` (if used)
   - **Protocols:** HTTPS

4. **DNS Resolution:**
   - Ensure that DNS resolution is allowed for the above domains. This includes `api.choreo.io`, `internal.choreo.io`, and any custom domains you have configured.

5. **Port Requirements:**
   - **Ports:** Typically, port 443 is used for HTTPS communication. Ensure that port 443 is open for both incoming and outgoing traffic.

How does Choreo ensure that my sensitive application logs and observability data remain within my private data plane and are not transferred to the Choreo control plane or other external systems?,"Choreo's private data plane observability architecture is designed to retain logs and observability data within the data plane itself. This is achieved by:

1.  **Data storage at source:** Logs and observability data are stored directly within the data plane.
2.  **Direct browser-to-data-plane interaction:** The Choreo Console in the user's browser directly interacts with APIs in the data plane to fetch this information, reducing potential data routing complexities.
3.  **Reduced data exposure points:** Fetching data directly from the data plane's APIs minimizes the number of data transfer points.

This architecture supports data locality, aligning with regulatory standards like GDPR and CCPA, and ensures user transparency and control over data access.","Choreo ensures that sensitive application logs and observability data remain within a private data plane through its architectural design and specific practices focused on data security and compliance. Here are the key aspects of how Choreo achieves this:

1. **Private Data Plane Architecture**: Choreo supports the deployment of private data planes (PDP) across major cloud providers and on-premises infrastructure. This dedicated environment is specifically designed to maintain user applications and their associated data securely.

2. **Data Storage at Source**: Logs and observability data are stored directly within the data plane itself. This practice enhances security by minimizing the risk of data being transferred to external systems, thereby simplifying access and ensuring compliance with data protection regulations.

3. **Direct Interaction with APIs**: The Choreo Console allows users to interact directly with APIs located in the data plane. This direct communication eliminates the need for complex data routing, thus reducing potential vulnerabilities.

4. **Reduced Data Exposure Points**: By fetching logs and observability data directly from the data plane’s APIs, Choreo minimizes the number of points where data could potentially be exposed or intercepted.

5. **Compliance with Regulatory Standards**: The architecture is designed to support data locality, aligning with global regulations such as GDPR and CCPA. This means that sensitive data remains in the jurisdiction it was collected, adhering to legal requirements.

6. **End-to-End Encryption**: All communications between the control plane and the private data plane are secured using TLS, providing robust protection against unauthorized access.

7. **User Transparency and Control**: Choreo provides users with visibility and control over their data, allowing them to manage access and understand where their data resides.

8. **Comprehensive Security Measures**: The architecture includes multiple security layers, including firewall protections, authentication, and authorization mechanisms to safeguard incoming traffic.

Through these measures, Choreo effectively ensures that sensitive application logs and observability data are kept secure and confined within the private data plane, without unnecessary exposure to external systems.

For more detailed information, you can refer to the documentation on [Private Data Planes](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/data-planes/#private-data-planes).","Choreo ensures that sensitive application logs and observability data remain within your private data plane through several mechanisms:

1. **Data Encryption**: All data transmitted between your application and Choreo is encrypted using industry-standard encryption protocols (e.g., TLS) to protect it in transit.

2. **Private Network**: Choreo can be configured to use a private network connection (via VPC peering or similar) to ensure that data never leaves your private network, keeping it isolated from external systems.

3. **Data Plane Isolation**: The data collected from your applications is stored and processed entirely within your private data plane. Choreo does not transfer this data to its control plane or any external systems unless explicitly configured by you.

4. **Access Controls**: You have fine-grained control over who can access the data stored in Choreo. You can configure access controls to limit who can view or interact with your logs and observability data.

5. **Compliance Features**: Choreo supports compliance features such as data residency and data sovereignty, which help ensure that your data remains within your jurisdiction and complies with local regulations.

"My Choreo service component exposes an API, and I need to manage its versions. How does Choreo's API versioning mechanism work, especially when I introduce breaking changes or new backward-compatible features?","For service components, Choreo implements an API versioning mechanism based on Semantic Versioning (SemVer), specifically using a `v` prefix followed by the major and minor versions (e.g., `v1.2`). You should increment the major version (e.g., from `v1.x` to `v2.0`) when you introduce incompatible API changes. For new functionality that is added in a backward-compatible manner, you should increment the minor version (e.g., from `v1.1` to `v1.2`).","Choreo's API versioning mechanism is designed to efficiently manage changes in service components. It follows Semantic Versioning (SemVer) principles, utilizing major and minor version numbers prefixed with `v`. For instance, a version might look like `v1.2`. 

### Versioning Guidelines:
- **Major Version Increment**: This occurs when there are incompatible API changes. For example, if a feature is removed or altered in a way that breaks existing functionality, the major version should be increased (e.g., from `v1.2` to `v2.0`).
  
- **Minor Version Increment**: This is used when new functionality is added in a backward-compatible manner. If you introduce features that do not disrupt existing consumers of the API, you increase the minor version (e.g., from `v1.2` to `v1.3`).

### Handling Breaking Changes and Backward Compatibility:
- Changes that do not introduce breaking modifications are typically categorized as patch updates; however, from the perspective of API consumers, these changes might still be communicated, especially if they could affect how clients interact with the API.
- The deployment tracks in Choreo facilitate this versioning by allowing API developers to specify the major and minor versions being delivered. This ensures that API consumers can continue to use older versions if they choose to do so, providing a smoother transition and minimizing disruptions.

When a new minor version of an API is published, the invocation URL for the major version will automatically route to the latest minor version within that major version. This ensures that existing client applications continue functioning without interruption while still gaining access to enhancements or new features in the newer minor version.

For more detailed information, you can refer to the following documentation:
- [Efficient API versioning](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/deployment-tracks/#efficient-api-versioning)","Choreo provides a robust way to manage API versions, which is crucial when introducing breaking changes or new backward-compatible features. Here’s how you can handle versioning in Choreo:

1. **Create Versioned Services**: When you create a new version of your API, you should create a new service in Choreo. This allows you to maintain multiple versions of the same API without side-by-side.

2. **Versioninging in URLs**: You can use the URL to specify the version of the API. For example, `https://api.example.com/v1/resource` for version 1 and `https://api.example.com/v2/resource` for version 2. This helps clients to explicitly request a specific version.

3. **API Gateway Configuration**: Configure your API Gateway to route requests to the appropriate version of the service based on the URL or header (e.g., `X-API-Version`). This ensures that requests are directed to the correct version of the service.

4. **Documentation**: Update your API documentation to reflect the different versions available. Clearly indicate which version is the latest and provide links or instructions for switching between versions.

5. **Handling Breaking Changes**: If you introduce breaking changes, you should increment the major version number (e.g., from v1 to v2). Clients that depend on the old version will continue to use the previous version until they are updated.

6. **Backward-Compatible Features**: For new backward-compatible features, you can increment the minor version number (e.g., from v1.0 to v1.1). This allows existing clients to continue using the service while new features are introduced.

7. **Testing**: Thoroughly test each version of your API before deploying it to production. Ensure that all existing functionality works as expected and that new features are correctly implemented.

8. **Rollback Plan**: Have a plan in place to roll back to a previous version if issues arise with a new version. This might involve updating your API Gateway configuration or rolling back the service in Choreo.

"When deploying a new version of my API service component in Choreo, how do I specify the API version (e.g., `v1.0`, `v1.1`) that consumers will see?","When working with deployment tracks for your API service component, you only need to specify the major and minor versions (e.g., `v1.0`, `v1.1`, `v2.0`). This information is treated as the 'API version attribute' of the deployment track itself. Choreo will then present this `vMajor.Minor` format to API consumers.","To specify the API version for consumers when deploying a new version of an API service component in Choreo, you need to adhere to a versioning mechanism based on Semantic Versioning (SemVer). Choreo particularly focuses on the major and minor versions, which should be prefixed with `v`. For example, a version could look like `v1.2`.

### Steps to Specify API Version:

1. **Major and Minor Versioning**: 
   - Increment the **major version** when you introduce incompatible changes to the API.
   - Increment the **minor version** when you add new functionality in a way that is backwards compatible.
   
2. **Deployment Tracks**:
   - When you set up a deployment track for your API, you only need to specify the major and minor versions that are being delivered. This information is used as the API version attribute of the deployment track.
   - Ensure you are communicating these versions effectively to your API consumers, as they are primarily concerned with major version changes, but minor updates might also be relevant.

3. **Documentation**:
   - It can be beneficial to provide additional documentation for consumers to understand the changes, limitations, and how to invoke the API, which further enhances their experience.

By following these practices, you can efficiently manage API versions in Choreo and minimize disruption for API consumers.

For more information, you can refer to the documentation on [Efficient API versioning](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/deployment-tracks/#efficient-api-versioning).","In Choreo, when deploying a new version of your API service component, you can specify the API version that consumers will see by using the ""API Version"" field in the deployment settings. Here’s how you can do it:

1. **Log into Choreo**: Access the Choreo platform where your API is hosted.
2. **Navigate to Deployment**: Go to the deployment page for the specific API service component you want to update.
3. **Edit Deployment**: Click on the option to edit or create a new deployment.
4. **Set API Version**: In the deployment settings, find the section labeled ""API Version"" or similar. Enter the desired version number (e.g., `v1.0`, `v1.1`).
5. **Save Changes**: Once you’ve entered the correct version number, save the changes to apply them.

This ensures that consumers interacting with your API will see the appropriate version number, helping them understand which version of the API they are using.","You are a helpful assistant made to answer questions about the Choreo documentation.

"Choreo's API versioning focuses on major and minor versions. If I need to track patch updates or other internal versions for my API service component, how can I do that?","While Choreo's API versioning for consumers focuses on major and minor versions, you can use external tools for internal tracking of patch updates or other granular versions. Publishers can accomplish this through standard Git practices, such as using Git tags, or by leveraging features like GitHub releases.","In Choreo, API versioning for service components primarily utilizes Semantic Versioning (SemVer), focusing on major and minor versions. The versioning format is represented as `vX.Y`, where `X` is the major version and `Y` is the minor version. Here’s how users can track updates:

1. **Major and Minor Versions**: 
   - Increment the **major version** for incompatible changes.
   - Increment the **minor version** for backward-compatible changes.

2. **Patch Updates**: While Choreo does not explicitly track patch versions (which typically involve internal changes that do not affect the API's interface), users can manage internal versioning through Git. This can be accomplished by:
   - Using **Git tags** to mark specific commits that represent stable or important states in the development process.
   - Utilizing **GitHub releases** to bundle changes, including patch updates, while providing a clear, versioned release history.

3. **Deployment Tracks**: When creating deployment tracks for service components, only the major and minor versions need to be specified. This means that while users can keep track of their internal changes through their Git repository, Choreo's API versioning system itself focuses on the major and minor versions for external consumption.

4. **Marketplace Visibility**: In the Choreo Marketplace, services are also displayed in terms of their major version, providing a clear view of which version is currently active or the latest available for that major version.

For more details on managing deployment tracks and effective API versioning in Choreo, you can refer to the documentation on [Efficient API Versioning](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/deployment-tracks/#efficient-api-versioning) and [Managing Deployment Tracks for Choreo Components](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/manage-deployment-tracks-for-choreo-components/).","Choreo primarily uses major and minor versions for API versioning, but it doesn't natively support tracking patch updates or other internal versions directly in its versioning scheme. However, you can manage these additional versions through a few strategies:

1. **Use Descriptive Names**: Instead of relying solely on numbers, use descriptive names for your API versions. For example, `v1.0.1-internal-hotfix` could indicate a minor update with an internal hotfix.

2. **Metadata or Annotations**: You can add metadata or annotations to your API definitions or service components in Choreo to track patch updates or other internal versions. This metadata can be used to provide more context about the version.

3. **Custom Attributes**: Some APIs allow custom attributes or tags. You can use these to mark specific versions as ""patch"" or ""internal"".

4. **Documentation**: Maintain detailed documentation that tracks all changes, including patch updates and internal versions. While this doesn’t change the version number in Choreo, it provides a clear history and understanding of each version.

By implementing one or more of these strategies, you can effectively manage and track patch updates or other internal versions within your API service components in Choreo.","You are a helpful assistant made to answer questions about the Choreo documentation.

I've deployed a simple Python Flask microservice to Choreo without providing an OpenAPI specification. How will Choreo expose its endpoints by default?,"If you don't provide a service contract like OpenAPI or GraphQL SDL for your Python Flask microservice, Choreo will use `/*` exposed on all HTTP verbs as the default contract to expose your service's endpoints.","Choreo exposes endpoints for a deployed Python Flask microservice by allowing you to define these endpoints manually when deploying your service. Here's how it works:

1. **Service Component Creation**: After creating a service component in Choreo, you can proceed to expose the endpoints during the deployment process.

2. **Manually Define Endpoints**: When you are ready to deploy your service:
   - Navigate to the **Deploy** section in the Choreo console.
   - Click on **Update Image & Deploy** in the **Build Area** card.
   - In the **Endpoint** pane, you have the option to define the endpoints for your service manually.

3. **Editing Endpoints**: You can create or update the endpoints by clicking on **Create/Update Endpoints**. This allows you to edit an `endpoints.yaml` file directly in the provided editor. 

4. **Default Behavior**: If you do not specify an OpenAPI specification, Choreo will use a default contract with the path `/*` exposed on all HTTP verbs. This means that all HTTP requests to your microservice will be accepted unless specified otherwise.

5. **Managed API Features**: Once the service component is deployed, Choreo will expose the endpoint as a managed API through the Choreo API Gateway. This provides benefits such as full lifecycle API management, API throttling, secure APIs with authorization flows, and analytics and monitoring capabilities.

In summary, you can expose endpoints for your deployed Flask microservice without an OpenAPI specification by manually defining them during the deployment process, and Choreo will handle the management and exposure of these endpoints as managed APIs.

For more detailed information, you can refer to the relevant documentation here: [Expose service endpoints](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/bring-your-own-image/#step-4-expose-service-endpoints).","When you deploy a Python Flask microservice to Choreo without using an OpenAPI specification, Choreo will automatically discover the endpoints and document them based on the routes defined in your Flask application. 

Here’s how it works:

1. **Identify Routes**: Choreo will scan your Flask app to find all the route definitions (e.g., `@app.route('/endpoint')`).

2. **Document Endpoints**: For each route, Choreo will create a corresponding API endpoint with details like HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.), path, and any parameters.

3. **Expose Documentation**: Once the endpoints are discovered, Choreo will expose this information through its UI, allowing you to manage and test these endpoints directly from the platform.

To ensure that Choreo can correctly identify and document your endpoints, make sure your Flask routes are properly defined and accessible. If you need to customize or add more details to the documentation, you can use annotations or other provide a minimal OpenAPI spec to guide Choreo further.","You are a helpful assistant made to answer questions about the Choreo documentation.

"I have a Java Spring Boot microservice deployed on Choreo, and I want to apply specific authentication policies to only the `/admin` endpoint, while leaving other endpoints like `/public` accessible without authentication. Is this level of granular control possible?","Yes, Choreo allows for granular API management per endpoint. Each endpoint exposed in your Spring Boot microservice is considered a single API. This means you can perform lifecycle management and configure security settings, such as specific authentication policies, individually for your `/admin` endpoint without affecting other endpoints within the same component.",,"Yes, it is possible to apply specific authentication policies to only the `/admin` endpoint in your Java Spring Boot microservice deployed on Choreo. You can achieve this by configuring Spring Security to apply different security rules for different paths.

Here’s a basic example of how you can set this up:

1. **Add Spring Security Dependency**: Ensure that you have the Spring Security dependency in your `pom.xml` or `build.gradle`.

2. **Configure Spring Security**:
   - Define a configuration class for Spring Security.
   - Use `@Order` annotation to specify the order of the configurations if needed.
   - Use `http` method to define security rules for different paths.

Example configuration:

```java
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.EnableWebSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter;

@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .authorizeRequests()
                .antMatchers(""/public/**"").permitAll() // Allow access to /public endpoints
                .antMatchers(""/admin/**"").authenticated() // Require authentication for /admin endpoints
                .anyRequest().authenticated() // Require authentication for all other requests
                .and()
            .formLogin()
                .loginPage(""/login"")
                .permitAll()
                .and()
            .logout()
                .permitAll();
    }
}
```

In this configuration:
- `/public/**` paths are accessible without authentication.
- `/admin/**` paths require authentication.
- All other paths also require authentication.

2. **Deploy and Test**:
   - Deploy your application to Choreo.
   - Test accessing both `/public` and `/admin` endpoints to ensure the correct behavior.

This setup ensures that the `/admin` endpoint requires authentication, while other endpoints remain accessible without authentication.","You are a helpful assistant made to answer questions about the Choreo documentation.

I'm developing a GraphQL API using Apollo Server in Node.js and want to ensure Choreo properly understands and exposes its schema. How do I associate my GraphQL SDL with the endpoint in Choreo?,"To ensure Choreo properly understands and exposes your GraphQL API, you should associate your GraphQL SDL (Schema Definition Language) as the service contract for your endpoint. Choreo supports both OpenAPI and GraphQL SDL for defining service contracts, which are then used to expose the endpoint to consumers.","To associate a GraphQL SDL with an endpoint when using Apollo Server in Node.js within Choreo, you can follow these general steps:

1. **Define the GraphQL SDL**: Start by defining your GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL) that describes the types, queries, and mutations for your service.

2. **Create a Service Component**: In the Choreo Console, create a service component where you will expose your GraphQL endpoint. This involves connecting your GitHub repository (if applicable) and setting up the project.

3. **Expose an Endpoint**:
   - Within your service component, you can expose an endpoint specifically for GraphQL. Each endpoint can have an associated service contract, which in this case will be your GraphQL SDL.
   - Ensure that your endpoint details include the correct protocol type (GraphQL), network visibility (Project, Organization, or Public), and any additional fields necessary for your setup.

4. **Configure the Endpoint**: You can configure the endpoint in the `component.yaml` file or through the Choreo Console UI, ensuring that the schema field is set to your GraphQL SDL.

5. **Deploy the Service**: Once everything is set up and configured correctly, deploy your service component. This will expose the GraphQL endpoint based on your configuration.

6. **Testing the Endpoint**: After deployment, you can use the integrated GraphQL Console in Choreo to test your GraphQL endpoint by writing and executing queries and mutations.

For detailed steps on configuring endpoints and exposing a GraphQL SDL, you can refer to the following documentation:
- [Configure Endpoints](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/configure-endpoints)
- [Expose a Ballerina GraphQL Endpoint via a Service](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/develop-services/expose-a-ballerina-graphql-endpoint-via-a-service/#prerequisites) 

These resources will provide you with the necessary guidance specific to Choreo and your use of Apollo Server in Node.js.","To ensure that Choreo properly understands and exposes your GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL) when using Apollo Server in Node.js, you need to configure Apollo Server to provide the schema to Choreo. Here’s how you can do it:

1. **Define Your Schema**: Make sure you have defined your GraphQL schema using SDL. For example:
    ```graphql
    type Query {
      hello: String
    }
    ```

2. **Initialize Apollo Server**: Set up Apollo Server with your schema. You can do this in your main application file:
    ```javascript
    const { ApolloServer } = require('apollo-server');
    const typeDefs = require('./schema'); // Path to your SDL file or string
    const resolvers = require('./resolvers'); // Path to your resolver file

    const server = new ApolloServer({ 
      typeDefs,
      resolvers
    });

    server.listen().then(({ url }) => {
      console.log(`🚀 Server ready at ${url}`);
    });
    ```

3. **Expose the Schema to Choreo**: When configuring Choreo, you need to tell it about your GraphQL endpoint and schema. Assuming you are using the Choreo CLI or API, you would typically specify the URL of your GraphQL endpoint and the SDL.

   - If you're using the Choreo CLI, you might run something like:
     ```sh
     choreo service add --name MyGraphQLService --type graphql --url http://localhost:4000/graphql --schema-file ./schema.graphql
     ```
   
   - If you're using the Choreo API, you would make a request similar to:
     ```json
     POST /services
     {
       ""name"": ""MyGraphQLService"",
       ""type"": ""graphql"",
       ""url"": ""http://localhost:4000/graphql"",
       ""schema"": ""./schema.graphql""
     }
     ```

     - **Environment-independent configurations** apply to all environments and can be modified in the **Deploy** page under the **Set Up** card.
     - **Environment-specific configurations** apply to a particular environment and can be modified in the **Deploy** page under the specific environment card.

4. **CI/CD Integration**:
   - Choreo supports a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) process, which allows you to build your application once and deploy it to multiple environments efficiently.

For more detailed guidance, you can refer to the following documentation links:
- [Manage Environments](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/manage-environments/#create-a-new-environment)
- [CI/CD](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/ci-cd/#configurations)
- [Resource Hierarchy](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/resource-hierarchy/#components-and-environments)","Yes, it is possible to configure a `staging` environment for your Java Spring Boot microservice in Choreo. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you set it up:

1. **Define Environment Variables:**
   - In your Choreo project settings, define environment variables for each environment (development, staging, production). For example:
     ```plaintext
     STAGING_ENV=true
     DEVELOPMENT_ENV=false
     PRODUCTION_ENV=false
     ```

2. **Configure Application Properties:**
   - Create separate application properties files for each environment. For instance:
     ```plaintext
     # application-staging.properties
     server.port=8082
     spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/staging_db
     ```

2. **Use Profile-Specific Configuration:**
   - Use Spring profiles to manage different configurations for each environment. Add the following to your `application.yml` or `application.properties`:
     ```yaml
     spring:
       profiles:
         active: ${ENV_PROFILE:-default}
     ```

   - Define profiles for each environment:
     ```yaml
     spring:
       profiles:
         development:
           # Development-specific settings
         staging:
           # Staging-specific settings
           server.port: 8082
           spring.datasource.url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/staging_db
         production:
           # Production-specific settings
     ```

3. **Set Environment Variable in Choreo:**
   - In Choreo, set the `ENV_PROFILE` environment variable to `staging` when deploying to the staging environment.

4. **Deploy to Staging:**
   - When deploying to the staging environment in Choreo, ensure that the `ENV_PROFILE` is set to `staging`.

By following these steps, you can effectively manage and deploy your Java Spring Boot microservice to a `staging` environment in Choreo, alongside `development` and `production`.","You are a helpful assistant made to answer questions about the Choreo documentation.

"When I start a new project for my Python FastAPI application in Choreo, what environments are available by default, and how does my project get associated with them?","By default, the Choreo cloud data plane provides two environments: `development` and `production`. When you create a new project for your Python FastAPI application, it will be associated with one or more of the environments available in your organization. This means your project can immediately begin utilizing these default environments for different stages of your application's lifecycle.","In Choreo, when you create a new project, it is automatically provisioned with two default environments: **development** and **production**. These environments are designed to facilitate the deployment and promotion of components within your project. 

### Default Environments
1. **Development**: This environment is typically used for initial development and testing of your components.
2. **Production**: This environment is where your components are deployed for end-users after they have been tested in the development environment.

### Association with Environments
Each project in Choreo is linked with these environments as follows:
- When you deploy a component, the initial deployment occurs in the development environment. 
- You can then promote this component to the production environment or any other environments you may have configured within your organization.
- If you are using a private data plane, you have the option to create and customize additional environments as needed.

Promoting components allows you to override configuration values with environment-specific settings, ensuring that your application behaves correctly in different contexts.

For more details on managing environments in Choreo, you can refer to the following documentation links:
- [Manage Environments](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/manage-environments/)
- [Environments](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/environments/)","When you start a new project for your Python FastAPI application in Choreo, the following environments are typically available by default:

1. **Development Environment**: This is the primary environment where you develop and test your application locally or on your development machine.

2. **Staging Environment**: This environment is used for testing your application before it goes live. It closely mimics the production environment but is isolated from production traffic.

3. **Production Environment**: This is the live environment where your application is deployed and accessible to end-users.

Your project gets associated with these environments through the following steps:

1. **Project Setup**: When you create a new project in Choreo, you specify the type of project (e.g., Python FastAPI) and provide necessary details like project name, version, etc.

2. **Environment Configuration**: During the setup process, you can configure each environment (Development, Staging, Production) with specific settings such as deployment targets, resource allocations, and other deployment-related configurations.

3. **Deployment**: Once your project is set up, you can deploy your application to any of these environments using Choreo's deployment features. You can choose which environment to deploy to during the deployment process.

4. **Version Control**: Choreo allows you to manage different versions of your application across environments. You can push changes to your codebase and deploy them to specific environments as needed.

By following these steps, your Python FastAPI application in Choreo is automatically associated with the available environments, allowing you to develop, test, and deploy your application seamlessly across different stages.","You are a helpful assistant made to answer questions about the Choreo documentation.

   - If the variable values should be treated as secrets (for example, if they include sensitive information like API keys), select **Mark as a Secret**. Note that if you mark them as secrets, you will not be able to view the values later.

5. **Define the Display Name**: In the **Display Name** field, specify a name to identify this configuration or secret. This is for reference only and will not affect the actual environment variables.

6. **Add Environment Variables**: Under **Add Environment Variables**, enter the necessary environment variables as key-value pairs. You can click **Add Item** to include multiple variables.

7. **Create the Config**: Once you have defined all required environment variables, click **Create** to save your configurations.

### Important Notes:
- Choreo allows you to maintain a separation between code and configurations, enabling you to deploy the same codebase across different environments (like development and production) with different configurations.
- Ensure that all configurations and secrets are securely managed since they will be encrypted at rest and in transit.

For detailed steps, you can refer to the [Manage Configurations and Secrets documentation](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/manage-configurations-and-secrets/#apply-environment-variables-to-your-container).

This process ensures that your application can seamlessly transition between environments while securely managing sensitive information like API keys.","To configure environment-specific variables like an external API key for your Docker container on Choreo when promoting it from `development` to `production`, follow these steps:

1. **Define Environment Variables in Choreo:**
   - Go to the Choreo Dashboard.
   - Navigate to the service or workflow where your Docker container is deployed.
   - Click on the ""Environment"" tab.
   - Add the necessary environment variables (e.g., API_KEY) with their values for both `development` and `production` environments.

2. **Promote the Service:**
   - Once you have defined the environment variables, you can promote your service from `development` to `production`.
   - In the Choreo UI, find the promotion feature (usually under the ""Deployment"" or ""Promotion"" section).

"I have a monorepo containing a Node.js API and a Python data processing service. How can I deploy both as part of the same application in Choreo, ensuring they share resources efficiently?","Choreo projects are designed to support monorepo architectures. You can include multiple components from different paths within a single GitHub repository into one Choreo project. At deployment time, all these components will be deployed into a single Kubernetes namespace, allowing them to function as a cohesive application and potentially share resources within that namespace.","To deploy multiple services from a monorepo in Choreo and ensure efficient resource sharing between them, you can follow these steps:

1. **Connect Your Repository**: 
   - In the Choreo console, start by creating a new project and connecting it to your GitHub repository that contains the monorepo. You can do this by clicking on **Start** under **Create Multiple Components** and then navigating to the **GitHub** tab. Authorize Choreo with your GitHub account and select your repository.

2. **Configure Components**:
   - Once your repository is connected, you can add multiple components from your monorepo. In the **Add Component Directories** pane, click the **+** icon to specify the services you want to deploy. For each service, provide the necessary configuration details such as the component display name, component name, path, component type, buildpack, and language version.

3. **Build and Deploy**:
   - Choreo adopts a *build once, deploy many* strategy, meaning you will build the application once and can then promote it to multiple environments. After configuring your components, you can deploy them directly from the Choreo console, which allows you to test them in different environments (e.g., development, production).

4. **Resource Sharing**:
   - All components within a project share the same environment, which means they can efficiently share resources and configurations defined at the environment level. This includes resource credentials and other configurations that can be injected at runtime, ensuring that your services can communicate and utilize shared resources effectively.

5. **Promote to Other Environments**:
   - After testing the services in lower environments, you can promote the build to production or other environments as needed, maintaining the same codebase while allowing for environment-specific configurations.

By following these steps, you can effectively deploy multiple services from a monorepo in Choreo while ensuring resource sharing and efficient management.

For more detailed instructions, you can refer to the relevant documentation:
- [CI/CD in Choreo](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/ci-cd/)

Here’s how you can achieve this:

1. **Use Internal Services**: Configure your Spring Boot API and GoLang worker as internal services within the same Choreo project. This ensures they can communicate over internal network segments without being exposed to the internet.

2. **Internal API Gateway**: Use an internal API gateway provided by Choreo to route requests from your Spring Boot API to the GoLang worker. This way, the worker remains hidden from external access.

3. **Secure Communication**: Ensure that any communication between these services uses secure protocols such as HTTPS or TLS. You can configure this in both services to add an extra layer of security.

4. **Network Segmentation**: If your project supports it, use network segmentation features to isolate the internal services from external networks. This prevents unauthorized access to the GoLang worker.

5. **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to control who can access the GoLang worker. This can be done through API keys, OAuth tokens, or other methods supported by Choreo.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your GoLang worker is only accessible by your Spring Boot API and remains protected from public exposure.","You are a helpful assistant made to answer questions about the Choreo documentation.

"I have a public-facing React frontend and a separate internal administrative API (e.g., built with .NET Core) that both belong to the same application. How can I deploy them in Choreo so the frontend is public and the admin API is only accessible within my organization?","Within a single Choreo project, you can define multiple components and set their individual exposure levels. For your React frontend, you would configure it to be 'exposed to the public internet'. For your .NET Core administrative API, you would set its exposure to 'internally to the rest of the organization'. Both components will reside within the same Kubernetes namespace as part of the project, but their network accessibility will differ based on your configuration.",,"To deploy your public-facing React frontend and internal administrative API in Choreo while ensuring the frontend is accessible publicly and the admin API is restricted to your organization, follow these steps:

1. **Create Separate Services in Choreo:**
   - Create one service for your public-facing React frontend.
   - Create another service for your internal administrative API.

2. **Configure Public Service:**
   - Set the frontend service as public.
   - Ensure it has the appropriate security settings for public access (e.g., no authentication required).

3. **Configure Internal Service:**
   - Set the admin API service as private or internal.
   - Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2, JWT) to restrict access to users within your organization.
   - Configure IP whitelisting if needed to further restrict access to specific IP ranges.

4. **Use Choreo Policies:**
   - Define policies for each service to control access.
   - For the frontend, use a policy that allows all public traffic.
   - For the admin API, create a policy that requires valid credentials from users within your organization.

5. **Set Up Authentication:**

"If I deploy multiple microservices, like a Python Flask API and a separate Node.js authentication service, within a single Choreo project, will they share the same Kubernetes namespace, and what are the implications for network communication?","Yes, if you deploy multiple components such as a Python Flask API and a Node.js authentication service within a single Choreo project, they will all be deployed into a single namespace of the Kubernetes cluster. This means they will share the same network space within that namespace, simplifying internal communication between them as they can typically discover and communicate with each other directly without needing external routing.","Choreo uses a shared Kubernetes namespace for all components deployed within a single project. This means that all microservices and other components associated with that project are deployed together in the same Kubernetes namespace. 

### Implications for Network Communication

1. **Internal Communication**: Since all components within a project share the same namespace, they can communicate with each other through internal service discovery mechanisms provided by Kubernetes. This allows for efficient and straightforward networking between services, as they can reference each other directly using their service names.

2. **Isolation from Other Projects**: Services deployed in one project cannot communicate with services in another project, as they are isolated at the environment level. This provides a layer of security and prevents unintended access or interaction between different applications.

3. **Deployment Model**: Each component corresponds to a single pod in the Kubernetes cluster at deployment time, which allows for independent scaling and management of each microservice while still benefiting from shared networking capabilities within the project.

For more detailed insights about how projects and components are managed within Choreo, you can refer to the [Project documentation](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/project/) and the [Component documentation](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/component/).","When you deploy multiple microservices, such as a Python Flask API and a separate Node.js authentication service, within a single Choreo project, they can share the same Kubernetes namespace. However, this is not mandatory; you can also choose to place them in different namespaces if needed.

### Sharing the Same Namespace:
- **Network Communication**: If they share the same namespace, these services can communicate with each other using simple service names. For example, if your Flask API service is named `flask-api` and your Node.js authentication service is named `auth-service`, they can communicate via `http://flask-api` or `http://auth-service` depending on their deployment details.
- **Resource Management**: Sharing the same namespace means that resources (like storage, CPU, and memory) are managed together, which can simplify resource allocation and management.
- **Security and Isolation**: Sharing the same namespace might reduce security isolation compared to having separate namespaces, as all services in the same namespace can potentially access each other.

### Different Namespaces:
- **Network Communication**: If you place them in different namespaces, you would need to use the full namespace name when communicating between services. For example, if the Flask API is in the `api-namespace` and the authentication service is in the `auth-namespace`, you would communicate via `http://api-namespace/flask-api` or `http://auth-namespace/auth-service`.
- **Security and Isolation**: Using different namespaces provides better security and isolation since services in different namespaces cannot directly access each other without additional configuration.
- **Complexity**: Managing multiple namespaces can introduce complexity in terms of resource allocation and monitoring, but it also allows for finer-grained control over each service's environment.

### Recommendation:
- **Same Namespace**: Use the same namespace if the services are closely related and need to communicate frequently. This simplifies networking and management.
- **Different Namespaces**: Use different namespaces if you want to enforce stricter security boundaries or if the services have very different operational requirements.

In summary, whether to share the same namespace depends on your specific needs for communication, security, and resource management.","You are a helpful assistant made to answer questions about the Choreo documentation.

I'm designing my application based on the Cell-based architecture principles. How does a Choreo 'Project' align with the concept of a 'Cell' in this architecture?,"In Choreo, a 'Project' is directly represented as a 'cell' with regard to the Cell-based architecture. This means that a Choreo project encapsulates a logical group of related components (like a single cloud-native application) and provides the necessary isolation and boundaries, consistent with the principles of a cell as defined in the Cell-based architecture.","A Choreo **Project** is fundamentally a logical grouping of related components that collectively represent a single cloud-native application. Each project can house multiple components, and all of them can be deployed within a single namespace in a Kubernetes cluster. This encapsulation allows for runtime isolation and facilitates easier management of the components.

In the context of **cell-based architecture**, a project in Choreo aligns closely with the concept of a **Cell**. A Cell serves as a governable unit that encapsulates a set of functionalities, allowing for better management and deployment practices. Just as a Cell can contain various resources and services that work together, a Choreo Project groups components that form a cohesive application. 

Key points of alignment include:

- **Isolation**: Both a Choreo Project and a Cell provide a form of isolation, meaning that components within a project or resources within a Cell can operate independently but are still part of a larger system.
- **Governability**: Choreo Projects can be seen as manageable units from development through to deployment, ensuring proper governance over APIs, events, and data, aligning with the principles of cell-based architecture.
- **Deployment**: When a project is deployed, all its components are managed together in a controlled environment, similar to how a Cell operates within a broader architecture.

Moreover, the deployment of components within a project can be exposed to various access levels, whether publicly, internally, or privately, which mirrors the flexible access control often found in cell-based systems.

For more detailed insights, you may refer to the documentation on [Choreo Projects](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/project/) and the [Cell-based architecture](https://github.com/wso2/reference-architecture/blob/master/reference-architecture-cell-based).","In the context of the Cell-based architecture, a Choreo 'Project' can be thought of as a single 'Cell'. 

Here’s how they align:

1. **Self-Contained**: A Choreo Project is designed to be self-contained, much like a Cell in the architecture. It encapsulates all necessary components and dependencies to perform its specific function.

2. **Independent Deployment**: Just as Cells are independently deployable, a Choreo Project can be deployed independently without minimal changes or dependencies on other parts of the system.

3. **Single Responsibility**: Each Cell in the architecture is responsible for a single, well-defined functionality. Similarly, a Choreo Project focuses on a specific task or set of related tasks, ensuring that the codebase remains manageable and focused.

4. **Modularity**: Cells promote modularity by breaking down the application into smaller, manageable units. A Choreo Project follows a similar principle by organizing code into logical, modular components.

5. **Isolation**: Cells are isolated from each other, meaning they should not depend on the internal workings of other Cells. A Choreo Project also adheres to this principle, ensuring that the project is isolated and can be developed, tested, and deployed independently.

By treating a Choreo Project as a Cell, you ensure that your application design aligns with best practices for modularity, independence, and maintainability, which are key principles of the Cell-based architecture.","You are a helpful assistant made to answer questions about the Choreo documentation.

"When I create a new `development` environment for my project in Choreo, how does Choreo manage the underlying Kubernetes infrastructure, specifically regarding namespaces and data planes?","When you create an environment (e.g., `development`) in a project, the data plane that is connected to your organization is automatically linked with an automatically generated Kubernetes namespace. This means your `development` environment will operate within its own dedicated Kubernetes namespace, which is part of the organization's shared data plane.","Choreo manages Kubernetes infrastructure, namespaces, and data planes through a structured process when a new development environment is created. Here’s how it works:

### 1. **Creating a New Environment**
To create a new environment in Choreo, you need to have the `ENVIRONMENT-MANAGEMENT` permission. Once you have the necessary permissions, you can create an environment by selecting the appropriate private data plane registered under your organization. This allows you to specify:

- **Name**: A display name for the new environment.
- **Data Plane**: The data plane where the environment will reside.
- **DNS Prefix**: This helps identify the exposed APIs in the environment.
- **Production Flag**: You can indicate if this environment is for production use.

### 2. **Data Planes Overview**
Choreo utilizes two types of data planes: **cloud data planes** and **private data planes**. The private data plane (PDP) is a dedicated infrastructure that offers enhanced privacy and control, while the cloud data plane provides a multi-tenanted environment. 

When a new environment is created under a private data plane, the process involves deploying necessary components on Kubernetes clusters, including:

- **Cilium CNI and service mesh**
- **Choreo API Gateways**
- **Choreo PDP agent**
- **Observability and logging components**

These components are typically installed using Helm, ensuring that the environment is prepared to handle user applications effectively.

### 3. **Kubernetes Infrastructure Management**
Choreo allows multiple Kubernetes clusters to be associated with an environment. This feature enables users to build resilient and resource-efficient solutions. Choreo synchronizes applications and workloads across these clusters, allowing for multi-cluster deployment with a single action. 

### 4. **Networking and Security**
The private data plane architecture ensures that all communication between the control plane and the data plane is secured via TLS, enhancing data security. The infrastructure requires outbound communication to the Choreo control plane for management activities, while incoming traffic is regulated through the API Gateway.

### 5. **Observability and Compliance**
The observability architecture is designed to comply with data privacy regulations, retaining logs and observability data within the data plane to enhance security and simplify access. This also helps ensure compliance with global regulations.

For detailed steps on creating a new environment and understanding the architecture, refer to the following links:
- [Create a new environment](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/manage-environments/#create-a-new-environment)

- [Environments and data planes](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/resource-hierarchy/#environments-and-data-planes)","When you create a new `development` environment in Choreo, the following steps occur regarding namespaces and data planes in the underlying Kubernetes infrastructure:

1. **Namespaces**: Choreo automatically creates a new namespace within your Kubernetes cluster for the `development` environment. This namespace isolates the resources (like services, deployments, and pods) related to this environment from other environments or projects. This helps in managing and securing resources effectively.

2. **Data Planes**: In terms of data planes, Choreo typically provisions a set of services and components that are specific to the `development` environment. These might include:
   - **API Gateways**: To manage and route traffic to different services.
   - **Services and Deployments**: For running your application code.
   - **Persistent Volumes**: If needed, for storing data persistently.
   - **Networking Resources**: Such as Ingress controllers, network policies, etc., to control traffic flow.

Choreo ensures that all these components are correctly configured and deployed within the newly created namespace to isolate them from other environments. This setup helps in maintaining a clean and organized development environment while ensuring that any changes or issues are contained within this namespace.","You are a helpful assistant made to answer questions about the Choreo documentation.
